 <h1 id="Conceptual Overview">Conceptual Overview</h1>
The speed of light is constant in empty space for everyone, clocks tick at different rates depending on how fast they are moving relative to an observer, and positions and sizes are different to observers moving at different velocities. To understand how, special relativity is needed.
In this chapter we will firstly talk about the classical view of how velocities are perceived from different observers, and then take a look at how moving between classical coordinate systems work, Next, we will find out how the classical view fails, as we find that for all observers the speed of light seems to be constant, and explain the experiment that showed this, then we will move on to the new frame work of special relativity needed to explain this, starting with position and time coordinate transformations between different frames and finally on how this effects velocity, momentum, frequency of light waves and energy, that rely on them.
In trying to make this none mathematical introduction as simple as possible, I have adopted as much of a visual way of explaining each part of special relativity as possible, this first chapter is in no way a full comprehensive description of special relativity, but it is as close as possible in this chapter without getting into the mathematics, which will be tackled in later chapters, to give you a much fuller understanding of special relativity.

<br><figure><img src="svg\lorry_cannonball.svg" style="width:100%; height:auto;"><figcaption><p>Diagram, showing the speed of cannon ball from two different perspectives, (top) is from someone's perspective who is on the truck who sees the cannon at rest with the road moving backwards, the cannonball is shot and is moving forward. (bottom) is from someone's perspective who is at rest on the road and sees the truck and cannon moving relative to them, when the cannonball is shot it looks like it is moving forward faster for them, as it seems to have the cannonballs velocity plus that of the truck it was shot from.</p></figcaption> </figure>
Let’s imagine a truck is moving forward on a road at a constant speed of 20 m/s (meters per second). on top of that truck , is a cannon that fires a cannonball in the same direction the truck is moving. The ball travels at a speed of 300 m/s relative to the truck . Classically to find out how fast the ball is moving relative to the Road, we add the speed of the truck and the speed of the ball together: 20 + 300 = 320 m/s. So, we find the ball is moving at a speed of 320 m/s relative to the road, and this is what we observe. So in classical physics, velocities directly add, the ball relative to the road would move at the speed of the ball relative to the truck plus the truck 's speed relative to the road. 
But this turns out to just be a very good approximation for objects in our normal day life that we are used to seeing, that are moving much slower than the speed of light ( which is roughly 300 000 000 m/s), but we will get to this later, for now we will explain more about the classical view, so that you will be able to see more clearly the differences when it comes to special relativity.
<h2 id="Inertial Frame of Reference">Inertial Frame of Reference</h2>
<br><figure><img src="svg\Reference Frames.svg" style="width:100%; height:auto;"><figcaption><p>Diagram of a reference frame moving relative to another.</p></figcaption> </figure>
A frame of reference can be thought of as an abstract coordinate system. The origin of its axis, its orientation, and its scale are specified by a set of points in space. The purpose of it is to provide a standardised means of measuring and describing the coordinates of objects within that frame at any instant of time.
An inertial frame of reference, is one that is not undergoing any acceleration. You can tell if you are being accelerated, as you will feel a force, take for example, in an accelerating car you will feel the chair being accelerated into you, with your body slightly lagging behind in the acceleration, and its this basic principle for how accelerometers measure acceleration as shown in the diagram. 
<br><figure><img src="svg\Spring_boxes.svg" style="width:100%; height:auto;"><figcaption><p>Diagram of a ball, attached to the walls of a box by springs, with the ball centred in the box in the inertial frame, i.e. with no acceleration (left), and in an non-inertial frame (right) where the box is now accelerating to the right, The ball lags behind as the box accelerates.</p></figcaption> </figure>
<h2 id="Classical Coordinate System Transform">Classical Coordinate System Transform</h2>
To see how to swap between coordinate systems in special relativity we will first have to introduce what the classical (Galilean) transformation of positions and velocities between two different reference frames look like. 
This chapter will be used as the classical analogy, for when it comes to the experiment that showed how light always travels at a constant speed.
To help us understand how to classically swap between inertial coordinate systems we will use a system of a moving platform, like we find on a treadmill. The two frames of reference will be that of the treadmills platform and that of the room it is in.

So If we have a setup of two rats on a treadmill (as shown in the figures), with 3 rocks hanging above the platform (hence always at rest relative to the room), with one of these being the rock in which the rats are initially under, and two more rocks equal distance from them, one which is in the forward direction of the treadmill, and the other perpendicular to this. Both rats travel at the same constant speed relative to the treadmills platform (rats speed is more than that of the platform), the platform can be seen as the medium in which the rats move (in the next section we will refer to the medium in which light was thought to travel through, as the aether).
Both rats will travel firstly to the central rock, then split and take separate paths to the different rocks and back again to the central rock, if the platform is at rest they will return back to the central rock at the same time. But if the treadmill is turned on and the platform is now moving, the rats will now also have to take the movement of the platform into account when travelling to the hanging rocks, this will lead to different distances the rats have to travel on the platform in the different directions to get to the hanging rocks. This leads to the rats getting back to the central rock at different times, in this classical system. This does require some math to show, which we will leave in the appendix, as an intuition is all we are looking for a the moment. 
In the rooms reference frame we have the platform moving backwards and the rats therefor taking extra time to to initially get to the central rock as their forward speed being impeded by the moving platform, once the rats split, the bu moving straight ahead will continue with the same impedance to its movement but after getting to the straight ahead rock, it turns around and now has a boost from the platform to get back to the rock, were as the sideways moving rat will have to go sideways and also balances out the backwards pull of the platform to keep a perpendicular movement in the rooms frame. (( put maths in appendix ))
when this is carried out the return to the central rock shown in the diagram (ref) will happen in different times.

*** diagram analogous to rat diagram for the light *** 
<br><figure><img src="svg\earth_and_aether.svg" style="width:100%; height:auto;"><figcaption><p>A diagram showing the Aether's and earth's movement relative to each other.</p></figcaption> </figure>
In the 1800's, the theory was that light was a wave and would need a medium (that filled the vacuum of space) for it to travel through (like water and sound waves), which was called "the luminiferous aether", and that light would travel at a constant speed relative to this aether, just as the rats in the previous section moved at a constant speed relative to the medium of the treadmills platform.
An experiment by Michelson and Morley was devised to measure this aether's movement \cite{EtherExperiment} through the earth/ earths movement through the aether, 
They reasoned that if the speed of light was constant with respect to the proposed aether through which Earth was also moving, 
*** make easier to read: ***
that motion of this aether relative to earth could be detected by comparing the speed of light in the direction of Earth’s motion through this aether and the speed of light perpendicular to Earth’s motion. To see if this motion of the earth through this aether led to the classical transformation between frames (as demonstrated in the previous section with the rats) and hence giving the speed of light always constant relative to the aether, and therefore a different velocity relative to earth, which would show the existence of the classical medium, aether.
*** explain experiment setup before the other stuff ***
The idea was that since earth was moving through this aether, that if light was moving in this medium like the classical rat in the previous section, that in the experiment shown in figure \ref{fig: aether} below, it would reach the detector at different times, due to its velocity being assumed to be constant relative to the proposed aether.
<br><figure><img src="svg\Michelson_morley.svg" style="width:100%; height:auto;"><figcaption><p>A diagram showing the Michelson-Morley experiment (mirrors equal distances from centre mirror)</p></figcaption> </figure>
The purpose of the interferometer shown in Fig. \ref{fig: aether} was to detect the "aether wind/flow" (movement of lights medium relative to earth) by measuring how it affected the speed of light in different directions when observed on earth. It did this by splitting a light beam into two parts using a partially silver-coated mirror at the centre. One part of the beam is reflected at a right angle, and the other part passed through the half silvered mirror. Then both parts are reflected back and recombined at the mirror and some of this is reflected towards a light sensor. By rotating the interferometer ((explain explicitly that this whole thing is an interferometer)), the two light paths could be aligned either parallel or perpendicular to the Earth’s motion through the presumed aether. If the aether (medium that light propagates through) existed, the time taken would be different to travel the different paths and get back to the central mirror and therefore the detector, and measurable in the detector, just as shown in section \ref{Section classical velocity addition}, which shows the classical addition of velocities in different frames of reference. 
However, when Michelson and Morley performed the experiment, they found no difference in travel time to detector for both paths, indicating that there was no difference in the speed of light in any direction relative to earth. hence no dependence of lights speed on the supposed aether. This null result seriously discredited the aether theories and ultimately led to the proposal by Einstein in 1905 that the speed of light (in a vacuum) is a universal constant and independent on motion of observer or source. 
It will turn out that to allow for us to have this universal speed of light (in a vacuum), it will require us to change our ideas of how time and positions are perceived by different observers. 
*** could include light version of the rat diagram, with light getting back to the centre mirror at the same time, also have grid length contracted ***
<h2 id="Speed of Light as a Constant">Speed of Light as a Constant</h2>
So the previous classical way of thinking about velocity addition was challenged when it was found through experimental observations (shown in previous section) that light when measured in a vacuum has a constant speed relative to anything observing it, independent of how fast the observer is moving relative to the source of that light (e.g. torch or laser). light may move slower through transparent objects such as glass, but this is due to it being impeded/delayed by the interactions between it and the material it is travelling through, which requires quantum theory to fully explain, which would be another book all together.
This is one of the postulates/basic principles that special relativity is formed from, i.e. the speed of light in a vacuum (i.e. without interactions with matter) is constant for all observers.
light itself moves extremely fast compared to any other everyday speeds we are used to (it can travel the diameter of the world in the blink of an eye, to the moon from earth in just over a second). This is why we don't notice any lag/delay in things we see around us in everyday life, though we should keep in mind that there is this lag, e.g. the light we see from the Sun was emitted by the sun 8 minutes ago for it to reach us now, or the light from other stars in our galaxy getting to us now only shows us see the position of the stars where they where thousands of years.
<br><figure><img src="svg\lorry_torch.svg" style="width:100%; height:auto;"><figcaption><p>A diagram, showing light being emitted from a truck from two different perspectives, the top perspective is from someone who is on the truck who sees the truck and torch at rest with the road moving backwards relative to them, the light is emitted and is moving forward. The bottom perspective is from someone who is stationary on the road who sees the truck and torch moving from their view relative to them, the light is emitted and travels forward at the same speed as before in this perspective relative to them, there is one difference, even though the speeds are the same, the light emitted in the lower frame seems to have more energy (due to the shortening of the wavelength (*maybe show Doppler image*)) but this is to be talked about in a later section.</p></figcaption> </figure>
When we look at the same truck setup as the previous chapters (with air removed from the setup so that it is in a vacuum) where the cannon firing a cannonball is swapped for a laser emitting light, and gives the same speed of light (roughly 300 000 000 m/s) when measured relative to the truck or the road, but how can this be true?
To account for the constant speed of light and ensure that no object’s speed exceeds it, we need a new way of thinking about velocity addition. Since the velocities of objects have to be added in a way that is consistent with the requirement that the speed of light is constant, but also give approximate classical addition at speeds of objects at much less than the speed of light like we observe with the cannon and truck , we need a new way of explaining this. Since the constant speed of the light depends on only the units of time and positions, the only way to correct for this is to also have the measured positions and times of objects/other observers moving relative to the first observer to be different relative to the times and positions of the second observer moving relative to the first. and this is what we will talk about next.

<h3 id="Time Dilation">Time Dilation</h3>
<br><figure><img src="svg\lorry_clock.svg" style="width:100%; height:auto;"><figcaption><p>Diagram showing the the extra distance light travels in the road's frame with truck moving</p></figcaption> </figure>
Let us imagine a simple clock that is made of a pulse of light travelling back and forth between two mirrors on a moving truck , one on the truck ’s floor and one on the roof directly above it, we will keep time by counting each time the light goes from the bottom mirror to top mirror and back again, we will take this as the clock ticking once. For an observer in the truck they will see the light go straight up and down between the mirrors, but an observer stationary relative to the road will see not just the light travelling up and down but also with the direction of the truck too, as shown in the diagram, and hence it will travel a longer distance. But since the distance travelled by the light in the moving frame is longer and the speed of light is constant, we are only left with the possibility that the perceived travel time of the light has to be longer in this reference frame. The relative change in distance travelled by the light during one tick gives the same relative change in how fast time passes. The observer on the road watching the moving truck would see the clock count slower. How much it is moving slower, can be solved using ratio of the lengths of paths in each frame as shown in the diagram.
This difference in the flow of time leads to odd consequences. Because speed is just the measure of a change in position per change of time (i.e. distance moved per unit of time). This means that to allow the speed of light to remain constant, we do need to have some sort of change in how we transform the coordinates of position or time between these two different frames.
This is also the same for any type of clock, and if you were to play a movie in the truck , it would take a longer amount of time for it to play through from the roads frame of reference.
The closer the truck goes to the speed of light, the bigger the difference in how fast time flows relative to the truck 's time (this can be seen as a longer horizontal stretch in the path taken for the light from the perspective of someone standing still on the road).
*** this section has so far assumed that the distances between the mirrors are not changed due to it being in a perpendicular directions to the motion of the truck , which will be addressed in a later section ***
<h3 id="Simultaneity">Simultaneity</h3>
<br><figure><img src="svg\lorry_simul.svg" style="width:100%; height:auto;"><figcaption><p>A diagram showing how the 2 events of light reaching the two walls of the truck are simultaneous in one frame but happen at different times in another, due to truck 's movement in this frame and the speed of light remaining the same</p></figcaption> </figure>
Now let us imagine a truck in its rest frame, with a light bulb in the middle and mirrors on the back and front walls, now if the light bulb gives off a pulse of light the light will travel from the centre of the truck to reach the mirrors simultaneously and back to the light bulb at the same time as well. 
But the observer on the road watching the truck drive past will see the light bulb simultaneously emit light in both directions and also simultaneously hit the bulb again after it being reflected back. But to do this the light reflects off each wall's mirrors at different times as shown in the diagram, because the speed of light is the same for both directions but the truck is moving, meaning the back of the truck is moving towards where the bulb was when the pulse was emitted making the distances travelled shorter, but also the distance the pulse travelled is longer in the other direction. Because of this and the speed of light being the same in both frames the observer on the road will see the light hit the mirrors at different times.
So, times of events (like when the light reaches either mirror) are different for different observers that are moving at different velocities, there is no one true order of events, as an observer in a faster moving truck moving in an opposite direction would also see a different order of events.
But for all observers the light will reach the central light bulb again at the same time, i.e. if two events happen in the same location at the same time (i.e. both light beams reaching the centre of the light bulb simultaneously) then this happens simultaneously in all frames of reference. 
I have left out any mention of length contraction (which comes in next chapter) and why it would be equal in both directions from light bulb in road frame of reference (i.e. for light to simultaneously return to light bulb they need to maintain equal distances from the central bulb)
<h3 id="Length contraction">Length contraction</h3>
<h4 id="3 car system way of explaining length contraction (may delete)">3 car system way of explaining length contraction (may delete)</h4>
<br><figure><img src="svg\cars.svg" style="width:100%; height:auto;"><figcaption><p>Diagram that illustrates an experiment with three cars initially at rest and equally spaced on a road. The middle car emits light that reaches the front and back cars simultaneously, triggering all cars to accelerate for a predetermined amount of time. Now another light is emitted from the middle car after the acceleration has happened, the road observer sees the light reach the back car first, as it is moving towards where the light had been emitted, this causes it to begin accelerating before the front car. This results in the cars being closer together after acceleration, demonstrating Lorentz length contraction, However, to the car observer, the distance between the cars remains unchanged from the initial distances.</p></figcaption> </figure>
Say we have 3 cars that are equally distanced and at rest on the road, the middle car sends out a pulse of light that reaches the front and back car at the same time to the road observer and the observers in the car, when it reaches them both, all the cars accelerate for a predetermined fixed amount of time, so that after this acceleration period the cars are now moving but still equally spaced relative to the observers in the car and the observer on the road. As for all observers the light reaches the front and back cars at the same time. 
now if we do this a second time and the middle car releases another pulse, in the frame of the observers in the cars: again the front and back drivers receive the pulses at the same time and accelerate, and again after the acceleration they have the same equal distance between the cars. But for the observer on the road, they see the back car receive the signal first as that car is moving toward the point where the light pulse was emitted and the front car is moving away from it. This would mean the back car would start accelerating first to get to the final constant velocity and get closer to the front car before the front car begins to accelerate, hence the cars end up closer together after all of this, this gives two different distances between the cars to the observers in the car and the road observer. This contraction of length between cars is called Lorentz contraction, which means that objects that are moving faster become shorter and shorter, the distances between the objects also become shorter.
<h4 id="truck Length Contraction">truck Length Contraction</h4>
<br><figure><img src="svg\Full_Lorry_Transform.svg" style="width:100%; height:auto;"><figcaption><p>A diagram, showing a truck with a square container in it's rest frame (top), emitting light from a central bulb in the four directions, with all light being reflected by the mirrored sides back to the centre. In the second frame with the truck now moving (bottom) we see the truck 's length contracted and what the light paths would be in this frame</p></figcaption> </figure>
If we have a truck in its rest frame with the inside being square with light emitted in all four directions from the centre of the square, so that it will bounce off the mirrored sides of the truck and return to the centre simultaneously. we require that in the moving frame they also all return to the centre simultaneously, as multiple events that happen at a single point simultaneously in one frame happen simultaneously in all other frames. This time between light being emitted and absorbed will be the dilated time, that was described in the time dilation subsection. 
To achieve this simultaneity in the return of the light to the bulb, the length of the path of light in each direction has to be the same (as its speed is same in all directions), we can work out the length of the upward path from the time dilation subsection at the start of this section, and this is the length the path needs to be in the horizontal directions as well, the paths can only have these length if the truck actual has a short length when moving, so the distance between the walls need to be contracted the correct amount, the exact amount can be worked geometrically. It turns out that the ratio of the increase in the amount of time that passes before light is reabsorbed is inversely proportional to the amount the truck is contracted in the direction of its movement. i.e. time passes by a factor slower in the moving frame, and distances shrink in the direction of movement, inversely proportionally to the same factor.
The reason that we do not worry about contraction in the distance between the floor and ceiling mirrors, will be explained in the next section.
<h3 id="No Contraction Perpendicular to the motion">No Contraction Perpendicular to the motion</h3>
<br><figure><img src="svg\Cannon_Balls.svg" style="width:100%; height:auto;"><figcaption><p>A diagram showing why there must not be contraction in perpendicular direction to frames relative motion. The top figure shows a ball and cannon at rest, the bottom figures show the cannon ball being fired in the frame of cannon (left) were the moving ball has a contracted width, and shows the frame of the ball (right) were now the canon is now moving and has a contract width, with the ball at rest being the same size, both frames would contradict each other, if there was a change in width of moving objects, as the walls of the cannon and the balls surface would overlap in one frame and not be touching in the other.</p></figcaption> </figure>
Suppose we have a ball at rest in a pipe such that the ball just touches the inner circumference of the pipe, if we were to now make the ball move we would have it Lorentz contracted along the direction of the movement, but if we also had it contract perpendicular to the direction of movement then in the rest frame of the pipe we would have the ball smaller such that it no longer was touching the inner pipe, but if we changed to the frame of the ball it would be the pipe that was moving and we would expect the pipe to contract and be smaller than the ball (so that the ball would get stuck), so in the two different frames we would have two contradictory outcomes, but we should be able to go from one frame to the other and not have these contradictions, so to have this we require that there is no change in size perpendicular to the movement of the object.
<h2 id="Doppler Effect">Doppler Effect</h2>
<br><figure><img src="svg\Doppler.svg" style="width:100%; height:auto;"><figcaption><p>A diagram showing (left) a central source at rest emitting several circular pulses of light with equal time between each pulse, (right) same source in a frame where it is now moving and emitting circular pulses of light, but each subsequential pulse is emitted from a different position as the source is moving, each previous position the source was when pulse was emitted is marked by a faded dot</p></figcaption> </figure>
If we have a source at rest, emitting circular pulses of light with equal times between each pulse, we will have concentric circular pulses in this frame, but if we move to a frame where the source is now moving to the right, each circular pulse is now being emitted from a different position as the source is moving. Due to the source moving, each pulse will be emitted closer to the right hand side of the previous pulses, creating a bunching up of the pulses (increase in frequency) in the direction of movement and a spreading out (decrease in frequency) of the pulses in the opposite direction, that is what happens in the classical version of the Doppler effect that you will notice that an ambulance or police car sounds different driving towards you and when driving away, this is due to the bunching up of the sounds waves in the direction of the moving vehicle. In special relativity, we also have to take the time dilation of the pulses into account, as there will be a longer time between each subsequential circular pulse, Due to time moving more slowly for objects moving relative to the observer, this has a decreasing effect on the frequency in all directions, but directly in the direction of movement of the source this is outweighed by the frequency increase from the previous bunching up effect.
We have the analogous effect from the classical Doppler effect on light emitted in the direction, as light is also described as a wave and hence the frequency and therefore energy (as it is proportional) is increased in the direction of motion of the source due to the Doppler effects and decreased in the opposite direction.
One thing not mentioned yet in this picture so far is how the light is also effected by what is called the aberration, which is the change in the direction of each part of the emitted light pulse, which leads to light not being circularly symmetric in each of the spherical pulses, which will be explained in the next section.
<h2 id="Aberration ((more todo))">Aberration ((more todo))</h2>
The picture painted in the previous section of the Doppler effect does not show the distribution and therefore concentration of the light in each spherical pulse of light, which we shall show that there is a higher concentration in the direction of the movement of the source.
<br><figure><img src="svg\Aberrated_lorrys_1.svg" style="width:100%; height:auto;"><figcaption><p>A diagram of a truck with a spherical container, with a light emitted from the centre of the container and reflected back by the mirrored wall to the centre, the truck at rest (top) shows a evenly distributed light pulse, but in the frame with the truck moving (bottom) the light is now more concentrated in the direction of the truck , which is required to allow the light to be reflected and returned to the centre of the truck simultaneously like it does in the rest frame.</p></figcaption> </figure>
<br><figure><img src="svg\Aberrated_lorrys_2.svg" style="width:100%; height:auto;"><figcaption><p>A diagram of the continuation of previous diagram, at the point the light is being reabsorbed in both frames, showing the the aberration of the returning light pulse</p></figcaption> </figure>
With the help of the truck length contraction section, lets imagine a truck with spherical container with mirrored walls, a central bulb emits light in all directions, in the rest frame all light reaches the spherical wall at the same time and returns to the centre bulb simultaneously too.
Then in the moving frame we have the spherical container Lorentz contracted and the light moving at the same speed but reflecting off the walls at different times, returning to the centre bulb simultaneous, for this we require that the directions of the light has to be aberrated in the way shown in the diagram to allow for this simultaneous return to the bulb. we have already seen in a previous section that the upward and downward light pulses are aberrated in direction of motion, and from this we should expect the aberration of the rest o the light to look like it does in the diagram.
From the diagrams you can see how light is aberrated when emitted from a source and also how it is aberrated when being absorbed by a source, the faster the source is moving the more the direction of each part of the light pulse is aberrated.
If the speed of the source was to approach the speed of light, all emitted light would approach the direction of movement of the source, if the source was theoretically able to reach the speed of light, all light would be emitted in the direction of the source but also move at the same speed of the source, i.e. the source would move with the emitted light, it would be emitted but not leave the vicinity of the source.
*** could say that if photon had mass and its influence of the gravitational force moved at the speed of light, then we would not be able to feel any gravitational effects outside the vicinity of it ((may be too much meh to leave in)) ***
*** but also due to the time dilation the time between pulses also tends to infinity
*** can also talk about an observers view of his surroundings is distorted by this aberration

If we now take both the Doppler picture and the aberration picture from the previous sections together, so that if we have a source at rest that is emitting spherical pulses of light with evenly distributed angles and a constant time between each spherical pulse. Then in a frame with the source is now moving we will have these spherical pulses bunched up in the direction of movement, with the angular spread of the light at a higher concentration in the direction of the movement of the source, remembering that each pulses origin was from a point in the sources past position. From this we can work out the distribution and hence concentration of the light for any moving source, relative to that of it at rest. 
<h2 id="Velocity Transformation">Velocity Transformation</h2>
We have seen in a previous section how the velocity of things moving at the speed of light transform between frames, i.e. their directions are aberrated, but when it comes to speeds less than light we need to transform them differently, and we need the transform to tend towards the Galilean transform as the speeds get slower and slower. To find the velocity transforms we will need to wait till we get to the mathematics unfortunately.

<h3 id="Perceived vs Actual Speed">Perceived vs Actual Speed</h3>
Suppose a ball, one light year (the distance it takes light to travel in a year) away from you, is fired directly towards you. It will take one year for the first light from the oncoming ball to get to you. If the ball moves at three-quarters of the speed of light, the ball will hit you in four-thirds of a year (a year and four months) after it is fired. The last light from the ball will reach you just as the ball hits you. As you see it, the time between first and last light from the ball is four months. During those four months you will see the ball start at its initial position and travel a distance of one light year. So the ball appears to you to have been moving three times faster than light. This is just how it appears to the observer due to the delay in the light signal/the retarded view of the system, leading to latency on how the system is observed.
This shows how important it is to take the delay in the light from objects into account when observing relativistic systems, this view is called the delayed/retarded view, i.e what we see now is objects in their past positions, and the further things are from you the further into the past we are seeing them. 
<h2 id="The More Abstract concepts of Momentum, Energy and Mass (delete this section)">The More Abstract concepts of Momentum, Energy and Mass (delete this section)</h2>
The more abstract quantities and do not have a simple visual interpretation in special relativity, and this is point at which the math is needed for a proper understanding. With the math you will find knew conservation of momentum and energy laws, but in this section we will do what we can to give an overview and basic intuition.

(diagram)
If we have two balls roll to the centre of a truck at rest are and hit each other and stick, giving zero overall momentum as both balls momentum cancel out, but to observer on the road the stuck together balls move with the truck , so the ball at the back of the truck must have more momentum before the collision...
*** so far this is also true for classical frame transform
From before we have that the consequence of the different times and coordinates is that if a moving object emits light, to allow the speed of light to stay constant, the transform will also have the consequence of changing the frequency of the light, and hence its energy.
Since energy is measured in units of position and time (as well as mass) the energy of a particle and systems in different frames have to go through transformations themselves, which leads to the famous energy and mass equivalence equation E=mc2 (this is the reduced form of equation)<br>
From finding how the momentum changes between 2 frames due to the Lorentz transformations we find a relation between the Mass of a particle and how much energy that this particle is equivalent to, i.e. if a particle with a certain mass completely annihilates with its anti-particle, it gives out photons, corresponding to the energy of the particle which is different whether it is at rest or moving, as the perceived mass of a particle increases the faster it moves<br>
*** mass is not increased only the apparent mass 
this also means that it is impossible to get any particle with mass up to the speed of light, as the closer the particle gets to the speed of light, the heavier it is perceived and therefore keeps requiring a greater and greater force to accelerate it, This amount of perceived mass tends to infinity and the force required to accelerate it would also tend to infinity.<br>
This and the previous chapters will also lead to changes in how we treat acceleration and forces, but these unfortunately have no simple visualisation for how they are transformed between frames.
<h2 id="Why Special Relativity matters">Why Special Relativity matters</h2>
So if you want a full descriptive model of a system with moving objects you need to include relativistic effects, but at speeds much less than that of the speed of light the relativistic effects are normally negligible when it comes to modelling physical systems ( but not always… as in electrodynamics of a wire where electrons are moving at low speeds but due to the vast amounts of them and the strength of their electric field they can still give non negligible effects on the force (magnetic force due to relativity, will need to explain how this is, or have mathematical chapter later explaining this) ) <br>
At speeds close to the magnitude of that of light, relativistic effects are required for accurate positions and times, which also lead to differences in masses and energies of particles, and wavelengths of light.<br>
<h3 id="Uses">Uses</h3>
Special relativity is used in calculating the decay rate of fast moving particles, and in the physics of particle accelerators (such as finding out how fast a particle needs to move to get to the energy you need to create certain other particles or get certain reactions to occur in an particle accelerator, and the radiation given off by accelerating particles)<br>
Relativity led to the famous energy mass equivalence principle \(E=mc^2\) which in turn gave us the ability to learn how to use radioactive elements to our advantage, such as using them for nuclear power, and for the more controversial use of making nuclear bombs. and in the future maybe nuclear fusion, in a fusion reactor<br>
It is also used to predict how fast other galaxies are travelling at, due to the effect it has on the frequencies of light emitted from fast moving sources leading to red and blue shift in lights frequencies.<br>
A high precision clock on a plane has been used to test time dilation, with the the clock giving different times to that on earth after certain amount of time in the air moving at the fast speeds (the time dilation effect is used along side general relativity (physics of gravity) to allow for GPS work more accurately)

 <h1 id="The Math Begins: Positions and Time">The Math Begins: Positions and Time</h1>
Now that we have learned about the basic concepts of special relativity, we can move on to the mathematics, starting with the classical Galilean relativity as a starting point, it will give us an understanding of how to transform between reference frames, and will give us the classical way to compare the maths and diagrams too when it comes to special relativity.
<h2 id="Galilean Relativity">Galilean Relativity</h2>
For Galilean relativity, if we have two observers moving relative to each other at constant velocity and want to find how each observer would describe the positions and motion of a particle, we need to know the positions and times in one frame and know how to transform them into the other observers frame. i.e. if we have how one observer would describe the coordinates of a particle over time relative to them and we want to now know the coordinates of the particle with respect to the other observer.
Before special relativity it was assumed that distances between two positions was the same for all observers, i.e. the first observer would see a stick and measure it to be the same length as another observer moving relative to them would measure it to be. long story short, lengths are the same for all observers in Galilean transform. Another assumption is that time is constant for everyone, i.e. clocks move at same rate for each observer and if a particle was to emit light at a time. this light would be emitted at the same time for the other observers too. so Lets see how the mathematics works for the coordinate systems for two observers. If we have a first observer we will describe the origin \(O\) of their coordinate system/inertial frame of reference \(\lt S\gt \). If in this frame, we have we have a particle at position \((x,y,z)\) and time \(t\), we will call the set of both of these, the event \(E\). \(t=0\) is when we have chosen for the origins of both coordinate systems to overlap.
<br>*** MISSING TIKZ IMAGE ***<br>
Diagram, of a reference frame \(\lt S\gt \) with its associated (x,y,z) coordinate system at rest in this frame, it also shows a primed coordinate axis (x',y',z') at time \(t=t'\) from the axis where overlapping, associated with another inertial frame of references moving at velocity \(v\) in the z-axis, it shows an event with position vector $\overrightarrow{OE
If we have the coordinate system to describe an event happening in one inertial reference frame \(\lt S\gt \) described by the spatial coordinates \((x,y,z)\) at time \(t\) and we want to find the the coordinates in another "primed" inertial reference frame and coordinate system moving at a relative speed \(v\) in the z-axis, with the coordinates described by \(x',y',z'\) at time \(t'=t\) where we define the overlap of the two axis a time \(t=t'=0\), so that the origin of the primed frame's coordinates at time \(t\) is \((0,0,vt)\)
For frame \(\lt S\gt \) we have it's origin \(O\) and an event \(E\) located at
\begin{equation}
    \overrightarrow{OE}=(x,y,z)
\end{equation}
and a prime frame's \(\lt S'\gt \) origin \(O'\) moving at relative velocity \(v\), so that in the original frame we have after a time \(t\), 
\begin{equation}
    \overrightarrow{OO'}=(0,0,vt)
\end{equation}
in \(\lt S'\gt \) we have the events coordinates as 
\begin{equation}
    \overrightarrow{O'E} = (x',y',z') = \overrightarrow{OE} - \overrightarrow{OO'}  = (x,y,z-vt)

\end{equation}
for \(\lt s\gt \) we have 
\begin{equation}
    \overrightarrow{OE} = (x,y,z) = \overrightarrow{OO'} + \overrightarrow{O'E} = (x',y',z'+vt')

\end{equation}
so we have \(x=x'\), \(y=y'\), \(t=t'\) and for the z-components
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
      &  z' = z - vt \\
       & z = z'+vt'
    \end{aligned}
\end{equation}
Which should be expected as this shows the symmetry between the frames, as if we where originally in the \(\lt S'\gt \) frame we would have the \(\lt S\gt \) frame moving at \(-v\) relative to the \(\lt S'\gt \) frame, so we would expect that the inverse transformation would replace one frames coordinates with the other and have the the opposite frame velocity instead.
So the inverse of going from primed frame to original is just a matter of swapping all primed coordinates with original coordinates and changing the sign on the frame velocity, this can be seen from starting at time \(t=0\) we have the frames origins overlapping and that there is a symmetry from here, could choose either frame to be the original, as no frame is particularly special and depending which one you pick the relative velocity is either \(v\) or \(-v\).
The full description of the position and time transform for an event is given as
\begin{equation}
    \begin{aligned}
      &  x'=x \\ & y'=y \\ &z' = z-vt  \\ 
      \text{at time \ \ \ } \\
      & t'= t  
    \end{aligned}
    
\end{equation}

    <li>The laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames of reference (i.e. if an observer carries out a classical experiment in an inertial frame of reference, he would notice no difference if he were to instead be in a different frame of reference and carry it out there (as the laws of physics should be the same to them in both frames))</li>

*** but they are not the only assumptions, you may notice some small jumps in the logic when it comes to the derivation. But be aware small miss understandings have thrown many people down the special relativity rabbit hole when trying to find inconsistencies or prove it wrong, through out this I will try to leave as few logical gaps as possible, and explain as simply and as in depth as possible so that you do not do this yourself.
<h2 id="Derivation from Time Dilation and Length Contraction">Derivation from Time Dilation and Length Contraction</h2>
we will start with a simple derivation following a similar thought pattern as in the previous chapter just with the direction of second frame in the upwards direction instead of being to the right in the case of the truck diagrams, this will help when we use spherical polar coordinates and to help see the symmetries, an alternative derivation using spherical light pulses is given in the abstract (ref).

we can have a clock which keeps time using a light pulse being emitted from a bulb towards a mirror and returning, recording a tik on its clock each time it returns to were it was emitted, taking a time \(\Delta \tau\) in the rest frame to return. The distance the light travels to the mirror and back in this time is \(2W=c\Delta \tau\) which, the distance the bulb travels in the same time is \(L=u\Delta t'\), where \(\Delta t'\) is the time it took light to return in moving frame and \(u\) is the speed of the light which is in the opposite direction of the primed frame relative to the proper frame, i.e. \(u=-v\), the distance light travels in this time is \(2D=c\Delta t'\) . this forms a triangle, so we have the square of the hypotenuse \(2D\) equal to the square of the lengths \(W\) and \(L\):
\begin{equation}
    c^2 \Delta t'^2 = v^2 \Delta t'^2 + c^2\Delta \tau^2 
\end{equation}
rearranging to find the time it took in the primed frame relative to the time in the proper frame, we find 
\begin{equation}
     \Delta t' = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-\dfrac{v^2}{c^2}}} \Delta \tau = \gamma \Delta \tau
\end{equation}
with 
\begin{equation}
   \gamma =  \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-\dfrac{v^2}{c^2}}}
\end{equation}
time taken between two events in the same position in the moving frame takes longer than in the rest frame of the clock

*the pulse sent backwards has distance \(L_1= ct'_1= D' - ut'_1\) to travel to back mirror that is moving towards the point it was emitted, and then has to travel back to the bulb a distance \(L_2 = ct'_2= D' + ut'_2\), giving \(t'_1=\frac{D'}{c+u}\) and \(t'_2=\frac{D'}{c-u}\) adding both times together gives total primed time \(t' = d(\frac{1}{c-u} + \frac{1}{c+u})=...=\frac{D'}{c}\frac{1}{1-u^2/c^2} =\frac{D'}{c}\frac{1}{1-v^2/c^2}=\gamma^2 \frac{D'}{c}\) giving \(ct'=c\gamma t = \gamma D = \gamma^2 D'\) and finally leaving to \(D' = \frac{1}{\gamma}D\)

one frame of event...
For frame \(\lt S\gt \) we have it's origin \(O\) and an event \(E\) located at \(\overrightarrow{OE}=(x,y,z)\) and a prime frame's \(\lt S'\gt \) origin \(O'\) moving at relative velocity \(v\), so that in the original frame we have after a time \(t\), \(\overrightarrow{OO'}=(0,0,vt)\). now from the last section, we have \(z'\) for the z-component of \(\overrightarrow{O'E}\) in the primed frame, length contracted in this frame as \(z'/\gamma\) so that \(\overrightarrow{O'E} = (x,y,z'/\gamma)\) with the x and the y-components unaffected due to the cannon and ball thought experiment.
so that we have in frame \(\lt S\gt \)
\begin{equation}
    \overrightarrow{OE}= \overrightarrow{OO'} + \overrightarrow{O'E}

\end{equation}
subbing in each part into this equation and rearranging the z-component we have 
\begin{equation}
    z' = \gamma (z-vt)
\end{equation}
now in frame \(\lt S'\gt \) we have \(\overrightarrow{OE}=(x,y,z/\gamma)\), \(\overrightarrow{OO'}=(0,0,vt')\), \(\overrightarrow{O'E} = (x,y,z')\), doing the same for these we have 
\begin{equation}
    z = \gamma (z'+vt')
\end{equation}
Which should be expected as this shows the expected symmetry between the frames, as if we where originally in the \(\lt S'\gt \) frame we would have the \(\lt S\gt \) frame moving at \(-v\) relative to the \(\lt S'\gt \) frame, so we would expect that the inverse transformation would replace one frames coordinates with the other and have the the negative of the velocity instead.
Now substituting these into eachother we have
\begin{equation}
    z = \gamma ( \gamma (z-vt)+vt')
\end{equation}
and rearranging gives
\begin{equation}
    t' = \gamma \left( \left( \dfrac{1}{\gamma^2}-1 \right)\frac{z}{v} + t \right)
\end{equation}
with \(\gamma^{-2}=1-v^2/c^2\) then giving
\begin{equation}
    t' = \gamma \left( t - \dfrac{vz}{c^2} \right)
\end{equation}
leaving full description of the location and time of an event as
\begin{equation}
\bbox[#fff9cf, 10px, border-radius: 10px; border: 3px solid black]{
    \begin{aligned}
      &  x'=x \\ & y'=y \\ &z' = \gamma (z-vt)  \\

      &  \gamma = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}}}
    \end{aligned}
    } 
    
\end{equation}
for the time transform the \(\frac{vz}{c^2}\) term is the cause of the events no longer being simultaneous in another inertial frame, and the gamma factor \(\gamma\), is the the term that causes the overall change in how fast time flows relative in each frame.

\end{equation}
between time \(t_1\) and \(t_2\) is
\begin{equation}
    \Delta \mathbf{R}_p = (\mathbf{R}_0 +\mathbf{U}_p t_2) - (\mathbf{R}_0 +\mathbf{U}_p t_1) =  (t_2 - t_1) \mathbf{U}_p =  \mathbf{U}_p \Delta t 
\end{equation}
(acceleration as well, but these will become negligible when we take an infinitesimal time interval later)
The Lorentz transformation for this with \(t=0\) is 
\begin{equation}

    u_x \Delta t\\ u_y \Delta t \\ \gamma \left( u_z \Delta t - v \Delta t \right) \\

\end{equation}
but this gives primed times to be \(\Delta t'=-\gamma\dfrac{v}{c^2} u_z \Delta t\), and we want to find the positions that have the same time, therefore we need to take away the displacement moved in the the primed time \(\Delta t' \mathbf{U'}_p \) which is
\begin{equation}
    \Delta \mathbf{R}'_p = \begin{pmatrix}
    u_x \Delta t\\ u_y \Delta t \\ \gamma \left( u_z \Delta t - v \Delta t \right) \\
    \end{pmatrix} + \gamma\dfrac{v}{c^2} u_z \Delta t  \mathbf{U'}_p.
\end{equation}
If we divide across by the change in time \(\Delta t\) and take this time change to go to an infinitesimal \(dt\) and substituting the time in terms of dilated primed time \(dt = \frac{1}{\gamma}dt'\) we then have the primed velocity given as 
\begin{equation}
     \dfrac{d \mathbf{R}'_p}{dt} =\gamma \dfrac{d \mathbf{R}'_p}{dt'} = \gamma\mathbf{U'}_p   = \begin{pmatrix}

Light travels extremely fast (roughly 300,000,000 m/s) compared to other everyday speeds we are used to. In the blink on an eye light could travel around the world twice. So we don't need to normally worry about the delay in the light signal, as the time to propagate the distances in our everyday world is very short, we can normally assume an instantaneous signal, and ignore the more complex modelling of the delayed signal. But when it comes to particle physics were the particles or astronomy where we might be dealing with speeds close to that of light and also huge distances, e.g. light has take 152,000 years to travel from the Andromeda galaxy, so we are currently seeing this galaxy where it was and how it looked 152,000 years ago. These past positions that we currently see are called the retarded positions/delayed view.

Proper frame
As visualised in figure (\ref{fig: Retarded field outward field transform}). If we have a light source particle \(p\), in its rest frame that had emitted a pulse of light in one such that it propagates along \(\mathbf{R}_{prop}=\mathbf{c}t_{prop}\) at an angle \(\theta\) from the z-axis and is currently at position \(\mathbf{R}\) at time \(t=0\), where \(\mathbf{c}\) is the velocity of light and \(t_{prop}\) is the time it took to propagate to \(\mathbf{R}\).
This system is then transformed as follows; the coordinate \(\mathbf{R}\) is transformed to 
\begin{equation}

    \mathbf{R'} =   \begin{pmatrix}
    x\\ y \\ \gamma z
    \end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}
the light pulse's velocity using eq. (REF) in Cartesian coordinates and particles speed in the primed frame \(u_p=-v\)
\begin{equation}

    \mathbf{c'} =  \dfrac{c}{\text{Å}} \begin{pmatrix}
    \frac{x}{\|\mathbf{R}\|}\\ \frac{y}{\|\mathbf{R}\|} \\ \gamma \left( \frac{z}{\|\mathbf{R}\|} + \dfrac{u_p}{c} \right)
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
The time that the particle emits the light in the proper frame is \(t_{ret}= - \frac{||\mathbf{R}_{prop}||}{||\mathbf{c}||}\) which corresponds to the time
\begin{equation}
    t'_{ret}= \gamma t_{ret} = - \gamma \frac{||\mathbf{R}_{prop}||}{||\mathbf{c}||}
\end{equation}
then in the primed frame, the retarded position at which the particle emmits the light pulse is
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{R'}_{ret} = - \gamma \frac{||\mathbf{R}_{prop}||}{||\mathbf{c}||} \mathbf{u}_p
\end{equation}
to find the position the light pulse is currently at, at time \(t'=0\), we have to rewind its time from the position \(\mathbf{R}'\) that its at when using lorentz transform at time \(t'= -\gamma\frac{vz}{c^2}= \gamma\frac{u_p z}{c^2}\) taking away the displacement it propagated in this time to get the current position of light to be ((\(t'_{prop} = - t'_{ret}\)))
\begin{equation}
\begin{split}
    \mathbf{R'}_l &= \mathbf{R'}_{ret} + \mathbf{c'}t'_{prop} = \left( \mathbf{u}_p - \mathbf{c}' \right)t'_{ret} \\
    &= \gamma \frac{||\mathbf{R}||}{\text{Å}} 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    \frac{x}{||\mathbf{R}||}\\  \frac{y}{||\mathbf{R}||} \\ \gamma \left( \frac{z}{||\mathbf{R}||} +\frac{u_p}{c}\right) - \text{Å}\frac{u_p}{c}
    \end{pmatrix} 
    = ...\\
    &= \frac{1}{\text{Å}} 
    \begin{pmatrix}
    \gamma x\\  \gamma y \\ z
    \end{pmatrix}     
\end{split}
\end{equation}
we have the ratio of the propagation distance as
\begin{equation}
    \dfrac{||\mathbf{R}'_{prop}||}{||\mathbf{R}_{prop}||} = \dfrac{t'_{prop}}{t_{prop}} = \gamma
\end{equation}

Light travelling relative to moving particle
For a particle \(p\) at rest emitting wave at light speed in any direction, we have the length the wave has travelled in time \(d\tau\) as being \(cd\tau\).
If we have a particle \(p\) moving at speed \(u'_p\) in the z-direction and wave being emitted in all directions from it, we have the wave emitted at an angle \(\alpha\) from the z-axis, travelling distance \(cdt\) in a time \(dt\), with the particle moving a distance \( u'_p \cos\alpha dt\) in the direction of this emitted part of the wave, this leads to a bunching up of the wave in the direction of the movement of the particle (\(cdt - u'_p \cos\alpha dt= (1-\frac{u'_p}{c}\cos\alpha)cdt\), the ratio of space the wave takes up in that direction compared to the rest frame is 
\begin{equation}
    Ratio = \frac{ \gamma \left(1-\dfrac{u'_p}{c}  \cos\theta \right) c dt}{c d\tau}
\end{equation}
since as wavelength is inversely proportional to the frequency, and this bunching up at the front will proportionally decrease the wavelength
\begin{equation}
    \Phi_r = \frac{c d\tau}{ \gamma \left(1-\dfrac{u'_p}{c}  \cos\theta \right) c dt} 
\end{equation}
with rate of change in time flow for both frames having the relation \(dt=\gamma d\tau\) we get the ratio of this
\begin{equation}
    \Phi_r = \frac{1}{ \gamma \left(1-\dfrac{u'_p}{c}  \cos\theta \right)} 
\end{equation}
the vector cosine relation is \(\cos\alpha = \frac{\mathbf{u}'_p \cdot \mathbf{c}}{u'_p c}\), giving 
\begin{equation}
    \Phi_r = \frac{1}{ \gamma \left(1-\dfrac{\mathbf{u}'_p \cdot \mathbf{c}}{ c^2} \right)}

A proper frame of a particle's differential solid angle element  (definition given in previous chapter (maybe move that subsection to here))
\begin{equation}
    d\Omega = \sin{\theta} d\theta d\phi,
\end{equation}
encompasses a certain amount of the wavefront, this is the same amount of the wavefront that is encompassed by the coinciding aberrated differential solid angle
\begin{equation}
    d\Omega' = \sin{\theta'} d\theta' d\phi'.
\end{equation}
We can calculate this element by differentiating both sides of equation (\ref{Cosine transform}) with respect to \(\theta\) \cite{hogg1997special}, which gives
\begin{equation}
    \sin{\theta'} d\theta' =   \dfrac{1-\dfrac{u_p^2}{c^2}}{\left(1+\dfrac{u_p}{c}\cos{\theta}\right)^2} \sin{\theta} d\theta =  \dfrac{1}{\gamma^2\left(1+\dfrac{u_p}{c}\cos{\theta}\right)^2} \sin{\theta} d\theta
\end{equation}
as \(v=-u_p\) now using this and \(d\phi'=d\phi\) (as the angle \(\phi\) is always perpendicular to the motion of the particle and hence unaffected by transformation) we have the solid angle in the primed frame given as
\begin{equation}
\bbox[#fff9cf, 10px, border-radius: 10px; border: 3px solid black]{
    d\Omega' = \dfrac{1}{\gamma^2\left(1+\dfrac{u_p}{c}\cos{\theta}\right)^2} \sin{\theta} d\theta d\phi.
    }
\end{equation}
The relative primed wavefront strength at a given angle is taken as being proportional to the amount of the wavefront per solid angle in the primed frame relative to that in the proper frame, referred to here as the aberrational wavefront strength weighting, given as
\begin{equation}

    \Phi_\Omega = \frac{d\Omega}{d\Omega'} = \text{Å}^2.

Rest frame of source and observer
When looking at moving objects we see them where they were in their past positions, due to the delay in the light signal, so lets talk about the transform showing a source particle emitting a photon to an observer, showing the retarded position the observer sees.
... explain how observing from earth works, as you would think the positions of stars at \(t'=0\) would be all over the place as it rotates around sun
... check equations (since I have everything in opposite directions in diagram, need to change equations?)
We know that a light signal will not instantaneously travel from one point to another it will take time as it travels at the speed of light, so this signal will be delayed/retarded.
system:
If we take the rest frame of an observer and source particle that emits a pulse of light from its position at \(\mathbf{R}\) so that it is received by the observer at the origin, at time \(t=0\). This would give the Propagation time as \(T_{prop}= \frac{|\mathbf{R}|}{c}\) (and hence the time the pulse was emitted as \(t_{ret}=-T_{prop}\)) and the velocity of the lights propagation \(\mathbf{c} = -c \frac{\mathbf{R}}{|\mathbf{R}|}\). and the angle \(\theta_{R} = \theta_c - \pi\)
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{R} =  c T_{prop} \begin{pmatrix}
    0\\ \sin{\theta_{R}} \\ \cos{\theta_{R}}
    \end{pmatrix}
    =  - c T_{prop} \begin{pmatrix}
    0\\ \sin{\theta_c} \\ \cos{\theta_c}
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
and velocity of light given as
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{c} = c \begin{pmatrix}
    0\\ \sin{\theta_c} \\ \cos{\theta_c}
    \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
The particle emits the pulse at time \(t=t_{ret}\) from \(\mathbf{R}\), so this corresponds to the primed position 
\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
     \mathbf{R}'_{ret} &=  \begin{pmatrix}
    0\\ c t_{prop}\sin{\theta_{R}} \\ \gamma \left( c t_{prop}\cos{\theta_{R}} - vt_{ret} \right)\\
    \end{pmatrix} = ct_{ret}
    \begin{pmatrix}
    0\\ \sin{\theta_c} \\ \gamma \left( \cos{\theta_c} - \frac{v}{c} \right)\\
    \end{pmatrix} \\
    \text{at time }& \\
    t' &= 
    \gamma (t_{ret} - \frac{v}{c^2} (c t_{prop}\cos{\theta_{R}}) = 
     \gamma t_{ret}(1-\frac{v}{c}  \cos{\theta_c} )  
\end{aligned}        
\end{equation}
we can see that this does agree with the lights velocity transform as well, as it is in the direct opposite direction to \(\mathbf{R}\) as it should be. With the light being received at the origin of the primed frame axis at time \(t'=0\)

Lorentz invariance of different 4 vectors, i.e. 4 position, 4 velocity, and 4 energy momentum vector
... If a physical quantity is lorentz invariant it means it is unchanged by a Lorentz transformation
... having conserved quantities helps us model complex systems and experiments (frame independent quantity)
Most of this is not as straight forward as previous chapters, and more hard to relate to previous coordinates, velocity and acceleration transforms as energy is a more abstract concept, but the main reason we cared about energy in classical physics is because it was a conserved quantity which is extremely important in classical mechanics, as it gives us tools to make calculations.
... we will try and find a quantity with the units of energy that will have a conservation principle associated
... the derivations to get the famous \(E=mc^2\) use approximations, and assumptions and redefined definitions of energy and momentum, and the energy-momentum relation used quantum mechanics to derive, which would require another book to go into
... so instead we use the most important thing we need for energy to be and that is to have a associated conservation rule, which means finding an quantity that is unchanged between frames and has a quantity with the units of energy
... to do this we will start from the "4 vector" "4 position" which we already know the associated conservation rule from
... The Lorentz invariant quantities are sometimes called proper time, proper position, proper acceleration.

We defined the space-time interval between two events:
\begin{equation}
    \Delta S^2 = -(c\Delta t)^2 +\Delta x^2 +\Delta y^2 +\Delta z^2
\end{equation}
(can be defined as negative of this) (show this is invariant for any primed coordinates)
all inertial frames of reference agree on this interval (can show it always goes to proper coordinates in this form when subbed in)
the proper time between two events \(\Delta\tau\) is also agreed upon in all inertial frames
and will also therefore agree on derivatives with respect to \(\tau\) (where it is the time between two events in the same location?), because they will be invariant
we have the position of an event in space-time given as a 4-position vector (what is a 4-vector)
\begin{equation}
     \mathbf{S} = \begin{pmatrix}
         ct\\x\\y\\z
     \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
taking a derivative with respect to \(\tau\) gives us the 4-velocity 4-vector with \(\frac{d}{d\tau} = \frac{dt}{d\tau}\frac{d}{dt} = \gamma_u \frac{d}{dt} \)
\begin{equation}
     \mathbf{U} = \frac{d\mathbf{S}}{d\tau} = \gamma_u \frac{d}{dt} \begin{pmatrix}
         ct\\x\\y\\z
     \end{pmatrix} = \gamma_u \begin{pmatrix}
         c \\ u_x \\ u_y \\ u_z
     \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
know to show that the magnitude of this is invariant by showing all primed velocities give
\begin{equation}
     ||\mathbf{U}|| = c
\end{equation}
The 4 momentum is defined as
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{P} = m_0 \mathbf{U} =  \begin{pmatrix}
         \gamma_u m_0 c \\ \gamma_u m_0 u_x \\ \gamma_u m_0 u_y \\ \gamma_u m_0 u_z
     \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
we have the Taylor series expansion of \(\gamma_u\) factor is
\begin{equation}
    \gamma_u = 1 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{u^2}{c^2} + \frac{3}{8}\frac{u^4}{c^4} + ...
\end{equation}
when subbed into 4-momentum, we have the time component and multiply by \(c\), we have 
\begin{equation}
   c \mathbf{P}_t = m_0 c^2\gamma_u = m_0 c^2 ( 1 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{u^2}{c^2} +\frac{3}{8}\frac{u^4}{c^4} + ... ) 
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
   c \mathbf{P}_t = m_0 c^2  + \frac{1}{2} m_0 u^2  + \frac{3}{8}\frac{u^4}{c^2} + ... ) 
\end{equation}
all terms here are in units of energy, the second term is the classical kinetic energy, and the higher-order terms may be seen as higher order kinetic energy terms that are very small for \(u<<c\), the first term does not rely on the velocity of a mass, but only the mass itself, and this can be taken as a new type of energy all masses have even when at rest, i.e. the energy at rest for a mass is
\begin{equation}
    E_{rest} = m_0 c^2 
\end{equation}
we will write this new energy into the 4-momentum
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{P} = \begin{pmatrix}
         \frac{E}{c} \\ \gamma_u m_0 u_x \\ \gamma_u m_0 u_y \\ \gamma_u m_0 u_z
     \end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}
the magnitude of the 4-momentum can easily be found to be
\begin{equation}
    ||\mathbf{P}|| = m_0 c
\end{equation}
another conserved quantity that does not depend on the frame and using this and the 4-momentum vector
\begin{equation}
    m^2_0 c^2 = - \frac{E^2}{c^2}  + (\gamma_u p_x)^2 + (\gamma_u p_y)^2 + (\gamma_u p_z)^2 = - \frac{E^2}{c^2}  + (\gamma_u p)^2
\end{equation}
giving
\begin{equation}
    E^2 = m_0^2c^4 +\gamma^2p^2c^2
\end{equation}
for stationary particles \(u=0\)
\begin{equation}
    E = m_0c^2 
\end{equation}
this does not work for a massless particles like photons, we have to use a different method of getting this, we know from before that \( \mathbf{P}^2 = m_0^2 c^2 = 0\) leading to the components giving
\begin{equation}
    \frac{E^2}{c^2} = |p_{light}|^2

- if we have a ball in its rest frame that emits a flash of light evenly in all directions, we will have the balls energy decrease by the amount of energy of the emitted light, and it will remain at rest after due to the light being emitted evenly in all directions

*** Dirac derived this and used quantum mechanics to do so, which is out of this books domain, still consequences of this equation to be explored, such as the "zitterbewegung"
Momentum in special relativity is defined slightly differently, to ensures that the law of conservation of momentum holds true in all inertial frames, as required by the first postulate of relativity (it is still approximately unchanged at low velocities). momentum of a particle with rest mass \(m_0\) is given the 
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{p'} = m_0 \frac{dR'}{d\tau}= \gamma_u' m_0 \frac{dR'}{dt'} = \gamma m_0 u'
\end{equation}
where \(u'\) is the velocity of the particle in this primed frame and \(\gamma_{u'}= 1/\sqrt{1-u'^2/c^2}\). you will some times the mass of an object referred to as \(m=\gamma_{u'} m_0\) which is the apparent mass of a moving particle.
(why not use 3d time differential equation here?)
<h2 id="Force Transform (TODO)">Force Transform (TODO)</h2>
*** one of the most confusing topics in special relativity, from the way it is defined, how its derived, and how it relates to other things<br>
*** (a note that the 3-force in special relativity is specifically defined as the time derivative of momentum \(\frac{d\mathbf{p}}{dt}\) and not not mass times the acceleration \(m\mathbf{a}\), this is due to newtons 2nd law holding only for the first definition in special relativity) <br>
*** This means that acceleration turns out not to be in the same direction as the force in special relativity<br>
force derivation is confusing as most sources give the time derivative of u and v as acceleration, (are they using each force has opposite and equal force, but that would not take into account the retardedness)
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{a} = \frac{1}{m_0 \gamma(\mathbf{v})} \left( \mathbf{F} - \frac{ ( \mathbf{v} \cdot \mathbf{F} ) \mathbf{v} }{c^2} \right)
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{F} = \gamma^3 m_0 \, \mathbf{a}_\parallel + \gamma m_0 \, \mathbf{a}_\perp
\end{equation}
<h3 id="not sure what this is">not sure what this is</h3>
The force parallel to the velocity of the primed frame is unchanged, \(\mathbf{F}_{\parallel \langle ' \rangle} =\mathbf{F}_{\parallel}\), and the force perpendicular to this is \(\mathbf{F}_{\perp \langle ' \rangle} =\gamma \mathbf{F}_{\perp}\), with total force, \(\mathbf{F}=\mathbf{F}_{\parallel}+\mathbf{F}_{\perp}\) and
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{F}_{\parallel} = \dfrac{(\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{v})}{|\mathbf{v}|^2}\mathbf{v}
\end{equation}
and substituting this into formula for total force:
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{F}_{\perp} = \mathbf{F}-\dfrac{(\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{v})}{|\mathbf{v}|^2}\mathbf{v}
\end{equation}
since \(\mathbf{F}_{\langle ' \rangle} =\mathbf{F}_{\parallel \langle ' \rangle} +\mathbf{F}_{\perp\langle ' \rangle}\) we can use equations above to get:
\begin{equation}
    \begin{split}
    \mathbf{F}_{\langle ' \rangle}  &= \dfrac{(\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{v})}{|\mathbf{v}|^2}\mathbf{v} + \gamma\bigg(\mathbf{F}-\dfrac{(\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{v})}{|\mathbf{v}|^2}\mathbf{v}\bigg)\\
    &= \gamma\mathbf{F} + (1-\gamma)\dfrac{(\mathbf{F}\cdot\mathbf{v})}{|\mathbf{v}|^2}\mathbf{v}
    \end{split}
\end{equation}
this is the same for electric field as it only differs by a magnitude to the force.<br>
this is similar to how we get the reverse transform: (is it the primed velocity used in this?)
\begin{equation}
    \mathbf{F} = \dfrac{1}{\gamma}\mathbf{F}_{\langle ' \rangle}  + (1-\dfrac{1}{\gamma})\dfrac{(\mathbf{F}_{\langle ' \rangle} \cdot\mathbf{v}_{\langle ' \rangle} )}{|\mathbf{v}_{\langle ' \rangle} |^2}\mathbf{v}_{\langle ' \rangle} 
\end{equation}
