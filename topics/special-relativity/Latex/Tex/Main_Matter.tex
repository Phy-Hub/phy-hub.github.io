\chapter{Overview of Concepts} \label{ch: Conceptual Overview}

To make sense of special relativity, we will first look at the classical understanding of the world.
Then, we will see how we must change these classical laws of physics to account for light's constant speed relative to all observers.
Which in turn will lead to many interesting consequences.
The chapter begins with an overview of the core concepts to help us understand why we need special relativity and what it means, leaving the mathematical details and deeper insights for the following chapters.

This chapter's concepts will establish the mathematical framework for later chapters, using physical objects, such as moving trucks on roads, to represent the different perspectives of various observers.
Whereas, in the mathematical chapters, we will use coordinate axes to represent the different perspectives (frames of reference).

Later, you will see the parallels between this conceptual overview and the mathematical chapters.
This chapter will provide an overview of all the required concepts for special relativity, building up the needed knowledge bit by bit, starting with our classical understanding of how perspectives (frames of reference) work and showing how our understanding must change if we are to allow all observers to view light as moving at the same constant speed.

\section{Classical Addition of Velocities} \label{sect: Classical Addition of Velocities}

Imagine a truck, carrying a cannon, is moving at 20 meters per second, and the cannon fires a ball at 100 meters per second relative to the truck.
Classically, we add the truck and the ball's speed, to find the ball moves at 120 meters per second relative to the road.
So, in classical physics, velocities are directly added.
The ball relative to the road would move at the speed of the ball relative to the truck plus the truck's speed relative to the road, as shown in Figure (\ref{fig: truck cannonball}).

However, this classical understanding is just a very good approximation for objects in our everyday life that we are used to seeing, which are moving much slower than the speed of light (roughly 300 000 000 meters per second), but we will get to this later.
For now, in the following sections, we will explain what an inertial reference frame is and how this works in the classical context so that you can see more clearly the differences between classical and special relativity.

\section{Inertial Reference Frame} \label{sect: Inertial Reference Frame}

A reference frame is a grid of coordinates that we can overlay space with, so that we can state with respect to it where and when an event occurs.
If this grid is stationary or moving at a constant velocity, it is called an inertial reference frame.
In the previous truck example, we could associate a reference frame with the truck, by introducing a grid of coordinates that is stationary relative to the truck and, hence, moving along with it.
This perspective, fixed to the truck, is the truck's frame of reference.
A second grid of coordinates, stationary relative to the road, can also be introduced, representing the road's reference frame.
These grids of coordinates are shown from the road's reference frame in Figure (\ref{fig: Reference Frames}).
%An unnecessary and more complex way of saying this is, that a \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame} can be thought of as an abstract coordinate system associated with an observer or object. The origin of its axis, orientation, and scale are specified by a set of points in space and their times. The purpose of it is to provide a standardized means of measuring and describing the times and positions of objects within that frame.

%Edit: make the diagram a Tikz diagram, and v in diagonal y and x direction, could also make a diagram of a grid of coordinates attached to a truck moving relative to a grid of coordinates attached to the road

An inertial frame of reference is a reference frame that is not being accelerated.
You can tell if you are being accelerated as you will feel a force.
For example, in an accelerating car, you will feel the seat being accelerated into you, with your body slightly lagging behind in the acceleration.
This principle is used in accelerometers to measure acceleration, as shown in Figure (\ref{fig: spring boxes}).

We will now look at how movement changes in classical relativity when we change between these inertial frames.

% ((a note on free fall being inertial frame)) You may have the question of what about when the box is freefalling in gravity, and the ball would feel weightless and therefore stay in the center of the box, yet the box is accelerating, that is the beginning of general relativity which is for another handbook

\section{Classical Inertial Reference Frames} \label{sect: Classical Inertial Reference Frames}

To see how to swap between \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}s in special relativity, we will first have to introduce the classical approach.

To illustrate this, we will look at a setup of two rats on a treadmill with a platform as shown in Figure (\ref{fig: 3d conveyor belt}), with three rocks hanging above the platform, which are at rest relative to the room.
The two frames of reference will be the treadmill's platform and the room in which the treadmill is in.
Both rats start under the same rock.
One rat runs to a rock positioned in the forward direction of the treadmill.
The other rat runs to an equally distanced rock to the side.
After this, they return to the starting rock.

Here, the platform can be seen as the medium in which the rats move.
Both rats travel at the same constant speed relative to the platform, with the platform either at rest or at a slower speed than the rat's motion to allow them to get to the rocks.

%█████████████
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 0.9\textwidth]{images/pdf/Conveyor_belt_3d.pdf}
	\caption{\textbf{Rats on a treadmill.} A diagram, showing a 3d view of a treadmill platform, with two rats and three hanging rocks, with arrows representing the rats moving from a starting rock to the other two equally distanced rocks, with the paths perpendicular to each other.}
	\label{fig: 3d conveyor belt}
\end{figure}
%███████████

If the platform is at rest, they will return to the starting rock simultaneously.
But if the treadmill is turned on and the platform is moving, the rats will also have to work against the movement of the platform to get to the rocks.
This will lead to different distances the rats have to travel relative to the platform, and as a result, the rats get back to the starting rock at different times.
Figure (\ref{fig: treadmill}) shows what the direction of movement of the rats and rocks look like in each of the \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}s when the platform is moving.

\end{figure}
%███████████

%\fi

From the room's perspective, the platform is moving backwards.
The rat that is moving along the direction of the treadmill's motion will have impedance to its movement from the backwards pull of the platform.
But after it turns around, it will have a boost from the platform to return to the starting rock.
Meanwhile, the sideways-moving rat will have to move sideways and balance out the platform's backwards pull to keep its movement in the direction of the hanging rocks.
This gives different lengths of paths depending on the \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}, as shown in Figure (\ref{fig: treadmill}).
The rats in the platform's reference frame, move with the same speed for all the paths, represented by the arrows.
Whereas, in the room's reference frame, we have a slower constant speed of the sideways-moving rat and two different speeds for the forward and backward paths of the other rat.
This leads to different times for the rats to return to the starting rock.

The rats here use the medium of the treadmill's platform to move, and similarly, it was thought that light needed a medium, called the aether, to travel through space.
If there was this medium, we could test how fast it moved relative to Earth by finding the difference between the return times of light emitted in two perpendicular directions, just as in the treadmill example.
So, next, we will look at the notion of a universal medium referred to as the \hyperlink{def-aether}{aether} and whether we can have the same frame swapping when it comes to light traveling in two different frames of reference, as we did in this section.

\section{The Aether} \label{sect: The Aether}
%, a Medium for Light} % and a Universal Rest Frame}

In the theory electromagnetism from the late 1800s, it was believed that light was a wave and, therefore, would need a medium that filled the \hyperlink{def-vacuum}{vacuum} of space for it to travel through, called "the luminiferous \hyperlink{def-aether}{aether}", and that light traveled at a constant speed relative to this \hyperlink{def-aether}{aether}, like how the rats in the previous section moved at a constant speed relative to the medium of the treadmill's platform.
It was from the theory of electromagnetism and the experiments performed from it, that showed that light should have a constant speed, atleast relative to this aether, but it was yet to be known that light would actually have a constant speed relative to all things.

If the aether existed, the Earth would be moving through it, illustrated in Figure (\ref{fig: Aether}).

%█████████████
\begin{figure}[ht]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 0.9\textwidth]{images/pdf/earth_and_aether.pdf}
	\caption{\textbf{The earth and the aether.} A diagram showing the proposed \protect\hyperlink{def-aether}{aether}'s and Earth's movement relative to each other.}
	\label{fig: Aether}
\end{figure}
%███████████

So, an experimental setup by Michelson and Morley, shown in Figure (\ref{fig: Michelson_morley}), called an interferometer, was devised to measure Earth's movement through the \hyperlink{def-aether}{aether} \cite{EtherExperiment}, by measuring how it affected the return times of light emitted in different directions, as observed in Earth's \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}.
It did this by splitting a single light beam into two perpendicular paths that are then reflected back to be recombined and sent toward a light detector.
By rotating a platform that the setup is on, the two light paths could be aligned, one parallel and the other perpendicular to the Earth's motion through the presumed \hyperlink{def-aether}{aether}.
They reasoned that if the speed of light was constant with respect to the proposed \hyperlink{def-aether}{aether}, just like in the rat experiment from the previous section, the split light beams would recombine at different times.

From the previous section's system of rats on a treadmill, we can see that the treadmill's platform is analogous to the \hyperlink{def-aether}{aether}, and the rats are analogous to the light.
Both have the room where these experiments are done as the other inertial reference frame.

%█████████████
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 8cm]{images/pdf/Michelson_morley.pdf}

	\label{fig: Michelson_morley}
\end{figure}
%███████████

However, when Michelson and Morley performed the experiment, they found no difference in travel time to the detector for both paths, indicating that there was no difference in the speed of light in any direction in Earth's \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}.
Hence, light's speed is not dependent on the supposed \hyperlink{def-aether}{aether}.
This null result seriously discredited the \hyperlink{def-aether}{aether} theories.
It ultimately led to the proposal by Einstein in 1905 that the speed of light (in a \hyperlink{def-vacuum}{vacuum}) is a universal constant and is independent of the motion of the \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} or source.

To allow for us to have this universal speed of light (in a \hyperlink{def-vacuum}{vacuum}), it will require us to change our ideas of how time and positions are perceived by different \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s.

\section{Speed of Light} \label{sect: Speed of Light}

The experiments within a vaccum, showed light does not just travel at a constant velocity relative to the proposed medium (the aether), and instead travels at a constant velocity regardless of the motion of the \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}.
The observed speed of light is independent of how fast the source and receiver of that light are moving in the frame, as shown with a moving truck's headlights in Figure (\ref{fig: truck torch}).
Light does move slower in objects such as glass, but this is due to the interactions between the light and the material, impeding the movement of light.

Light itself moves extremely fast compared to any other everyday speeds we are used to (roughly 300 000 000 meters per second; it can travel the world's diameter in the blink of an eye).
This is why we do not notice any delay in the light arrriving from the things we see in everyday life, and we assume everything to be located where we are currently seeing it, though we should remember that there is this delay.
For example, the light we currently see from the sun was emitted eight minutes ago for it to reach us now, and the further an object is located from us, the further back in time we are currently seeing it because of this delay.

When we look at the same truck setup as in Figure (\ref{fig: truck cannonball}), but now have it in a \hyperlink{def-vacuum}{vacuum}, where the cannon firing a cannonball is swapped for headlights emitting light, we will find the same speed of light when measured relative to the truck or the road, but how can this be true?

%█████████████
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 8cm]{images/pdf/lorry_torch.pdf}
	\caption{\textbf{Emitted light in different frames.} A diagram, showing light emitted from a truck in two different \protect\hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}s, with the emitted light having the same speed in each frame, though with different frequencies and energies due to the \protect\hyperlink{def-doppler-effect}{Doppler effect}, which will be explained later.}
	\label{fig: truck torch}
\end{figure}
%███████████

For this to be true, we need a new way of thinking about velocity addition.
This is because the velocities of objects must be added in a way that is consistent with the requirement that the speed of light is constant but also gives the approximate classical addition at speeds of objects at much less than the speed of light, like how we observed in the situation with the cannon and truck, shown in Figure (\ref{fig: truck cannonball}).
Since the speed of the light depends only on the units of time and positions, the only way to correct for this is to have the measured positions and times of objects \hyperlink{def-transform}{transform} differently when swapping between \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}s than the classical way.
This is what we will talk about next.
For the curious, it was the experiment by Ole Rømer (\href{https://scienceready.com.au/pages/determination-of-speed-of-light}{link}) that showed that light traveled at a finite speed rather than being instantaneously emitted and received.

\section{Position and Time} \label{sect: Position and Time}

%███████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████████
\subsection{Time Dilation} \label{Subsect: Time Dilation}

Consider a simple clock, as shown in Figure (\ref{fig: truck clock}), made of a light pulse moving back and forth vertically between two mirrors on a moving truck, one on the truck's floor and the other on the roof directly above it.
Each tick of the clock is defined as the time it takes for the light to travel from one mirror to the other and back.
For an \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} in the truck, they will see the light go straight up and down between the mirrors, but an \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} stationary relative to the road will see not just the light traveling up and down but also with the direction of the truck to allow it to travel back and forth between the mirrors.

%█████████████
\begin{figure}[H]
	\centering
	\includegraphics[width = 8cm]{images/pdf/lorry_clock.pdf}
	\caption{\textbf{Light clock on a truck.} A diagram, showing a clock consisting of light being reflected between the floor and roof of a truck to keep time, in the truck's frame (top), and in the road's frame with the truck moving (bottom).}

\end{figure}
%███████████

%█████████████████████████████████
\iffalse javascript{createTruckDiagram: 2, Math.PI / 2 } %█
\fi%██████████████████████████████

Given that the distance traveled by the light in the frame with the truck moving is longer, and from the previous sections we know that the speed of light is the same for both reference frames, to keep the speed of light invariant: the clock itself must tick slower in moving objects.

How much slower the time is passing in the moving truck relative to the road observer can be solved using the ratio of the lengths of the paths in each frame as shown in Figure (\ref{fig: truck clock}), as this is the same ratio as the time between the ticks.

Importantly, this time dilation phenomenon isn't limited to light clocks; it applies universally to all types of clocks.
If you were to play a movie on the truck, it would take a longer time for it to play through from start to finish for an observer watching it from the road's \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}.
An observer on the road and in the truck experience time at different rates.
This is not just an illusion, it is physical reality.

The closer the truck goes to the speed of light, the more significant the difference in how fast the road frame's time flows relative to the truck frame's time.
This can be seen as an increasingly longer horizontal stretch in the path taken for the light from the perspective of someone standing still on the road, with the time between each tick approaching infinity as the speed of the truck approaches the speed of light.

You may ask about the possibility that the distance between the floor and roof of the truck becoming smaller the faster the truck is moving relative to the road, to allow for the light clock to tick at the same speed, and to get rid of the need for the time dilation, but that would actually lead to contradictions which will be shown later in figure (\ref{fig: width contraction}).

Now, if we instead had two trucks moving at the same speed relative to the road but in opposite directions.
Each truck would see its light moving vertically up and down with the other truck's light moving a longer diagonal path.
Hence, each truck perceives the other truck's clock ticking slower.
An observer in the road's reference frame would see both trucks move at the same speed and, hence, their diagonal paths having the same length, giving the same passage of time between ticks for both trucks.
That is, The slowing of time of moving objects is the same regardless of its relative direction of motion, only the relative speed changes the travelled distance of the ticking light.
This concept is confusing and difficult to visualize, but it will get easier with practice.

For now, though, we will continue building up the concepts of special relativity.

\subsection{Simultaneity} \label{subsect: Simultaneity}

Imagine a truck in its \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame}, with a light bulb in the middle and mirrors on the front and back walls.
If the light bulb gives off a pulse of light, the light will travel from the center of the truck to reach the mirrors \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously} and back to reach the light bulb also \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously}.
An \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} on the road watching the truck drive past will see the light bulb \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously} emit light in both directions and \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously} return to the bulb again.
However, the light reflects off each wall's mirrors at different times in the road's frame to do this, as shown in Figure (\ref{fig: truck simultaneity}).
This is because the speed of light is the same for both directions, but the truck is moving, meaning the back of the truck is moving towards where the bulb was when the light pulse was emitted, making the distance traveled shorter.
The light travels a longer distance to the front wall due to the wall moving away from where it was emitted.
Because of this, the \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} on the road will see the light hit the mirrors at different times.

%█████████████
\begin{figure}[htbp]

\end{figure}

\fi%██████████████████████████████

Consequently, times of \hyperlink{def-event}{event}s, such as when the light reaches either mirror, are different for \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s in different \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}s.
There is no one true order of \hyperlink{def-event}{event}s.
For example, an \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} in a faster-moving vehicle moving in the opposite direction would see the light reach the front wall first.
However, for all \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s, the light will return to the central light bulb \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously}.
If two \hyperlink{def-event}{event}s happen in the same position \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously}, then this happens \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously} in all frames of reference.
This means the light returns to the center of the light bulb \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously} in each frame.

A note here is that we are talking about when the events \textbf{actually} happen in each frame and not when the light from these events reaches the observer, which is later due to the time it takes the light from an event to travel to the observer for them to see it.
Also, I have left out any mention of \hyperlink{def-length-contraction}{length contraction} of the truck, which will be introduced in the next section, and why it needs to be equal in both directions from the lightbulb for the light to \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously} return to the light bulb.

% when two point particles/events overlap at certain time, this corresponds to the time they overlap in a different frame

\subsection{Length Contraction} \label{subsect: Length Contraction}

Consider a truck, in its \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame} carrying a square container.
If a light bulb at the square container's center emits light in the two horizontal directions and the two vertical directions it will bounce off the mirrored sides of the truck and return to the center \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously}.
We require that in the moving frame, they also all return to the center \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously}, as multiple \hyperlink{def-event}{event}s that happen at a single point \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously} in one frame, must happen \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously} in all other frames.
The light reflects off the walls at different locations, so the order of reflections in time will depend upon the relative observer, as described in the previous section.
The time between the light being emitted and absorbed from the light bulb is the \hyperlink{def-time-dilation}{dilated time}, that was described in section (\ref{Subsect: Time Dilation}).

To achieve this \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneity} in the return of the light to the bulb, the total length of the path of light in each of the four directions must be the same, as lights speed is the same in all directions.
We can work out the length of the up and downward path from the \hyperlink{def-time-dilation}{time dilation} section (\ref{Subsect: Time Dilation}), and this is the length the path needs to be in the horizontal directions as well.
The paths can only have this length if the truck is contracted in the direction of its motion, to allow for the light to be relected from the walls at the required positions for these path lengths.
The amount of contraction is same in both directions.
The exact amount of the contraction can be worked geometrically, and it turns out that the ratio of the increase in the amount of time that passes before the light is reabsorbed is inversely proportional to the amount the truck is contracted in the direction of its movement.
That is, if in a moving frame the time is dilated so that the light clock takes twice as long between ticks, then the length of the moving lorry becomes half of its length when at rest.
This is shown in the following figure.

We now know that moving objects must shrink in the direction they move to allow for a consistent speed of light in each frame.
But this srinking is not noticeable when objects move much slower than light speed.
If you are unsatisfied with this, the next section will reason the need for length contraction in another way using three accelerating cars.
But first we will look at the reason we did not consider any change in sizes of moving objects in the directions perpendicular to an object's movement.

If we look at the possibility that a moving object contracts in the direction perpendicular to the direction of its movement, we find out that this leads to contradictions, as shown in figure (\ref{fig: width contraction}).
As it allows for the possibility that a moving objects size in the perpendicular direction is smaller than a container when being observed in a containers rest frame but is bigger than its container in the object's frame.
Which is impossible as this would break the container just becuase you decided to viewed the object from a different reference frame.

Both frames would contradict each other if there was a change in the width of moving objects, as the walls of the cannon and the surface of the ball would overlap in one frame and have a gap between them in the other. So, we require no size change perpendicular to the object's movement.}

\end{figure}
%███████████

In the previous section we had in the frame with the truck moving, that the emitted light reaches the top and bottom of the square container at the same time.
But the times it reachs the left and right walls are non-simulataneous, and it is this difference in timings that allows the truck to contract in the direction of movement without the contradictions that are present when we look at the possibility of contraction in the perpendicular direction to the movement.

%Suppose we have a ball at rest in a pipe such that the ball touches the inner circumference of the pipe; if we were to make now the ball move, we would have it Lorentz contracted along the direction of the movement, but if we also had it contract perpendicular to the direction of movement then in the rest frame of the pipe we would have the ball smaller such that it no longer was touching the inner pipe, but if we changed to the frame of the ball it would be the pipe that was moving. We would expect the pipe to contract and be smaller than the ball (so that the ball would get stuck), so in the two different frames, we would have two contradictory outcomes. Still, we should be able to go from one frame to the other and not have these contradictions, so we require that there is no size change perpendicular to the object's movement.

% The faster you go, the closer things are in that frame, so it would take a shorter amount of time to get to places the closer you get to the speed of light (is this true)

	\caption{\textbf{Length contraction between three accelerating cars.} A diagram, illustrating an experiment with three cars initially at rest and equally spaced on a road. The middle car emits light that reaches the front and back cars \protect\hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously}, triggering all cars to accelerate for a predetermined time. Now another light is emitted from the middle car after the acceleration has finished, the road \protect\hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} sees this second light pulse reach the back car first, as it is moving towards where the light had been emitted, this causes it to begin accelerating before the front car. This results in the cars being closer together after acceleration, demonstrating Lorentz \protect\hyperlink{def-length-contraction}{length contraction}. However, to the car \protect\hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}, the distance between the cars remains unchanged from the initial distances.}
	\label{fig: cars}
\end{figure}
%███████████

Suppose we have three equally distanced cars at rest on the road, as shown in Figure (\ref{fig: cars}).
If the middle car sends out a pulse of light, it will reach the front and back car at the same time for the road \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} and the \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s in the car. When it reaches them both, all the cars accelerate for a predetermined fixed amount of time to the same speed.
Following this acceleration period, the cars have maintained equal spacing relative to both the car observers and the observer on the road.
As for all \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s, the light reached the front and back cars at the same time.

Now, suppose we do this a second time, with the middle car releasing another pulse.
In this case, we have in the frame of the \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s in the cars: again, with the front and back drivers receiving the pulses simultaneously, meaning that they will start accelerating simultaneously.
After the acceleration has finished, the distances between the cars will be the same for the car observers.
But for the road \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}, they see the back car receive the signal first, as that car is moving towards the point where the light pulse was emitted, and the front car is moving away from it.
This would mean the back car would start accelerating first to get to the final constant velocity and get closer to the front car before the front car begins to accelerate to that same final speed that the back car had already reached.
This results in the cars being closer together after the acceleration.
The \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s in the car and the road \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} disagree with what the distances between the cars are.
This contraction of length between cars, in the road's frame in which the cars are moving, is called Lorentz \hyperlink{def-length-contraction}{length contraction}, which means that objects that are moving faster become shorter, and the distances between the objects also become shorter.

\section{Doppler Effect} \label{sect: Intro Doppler Effect}

If we have a light source at rest, emitting circular pulses of light with equal times between each pulse, we will have concentric circular pulses in this frame.
But, if we move to a frame where the source is now moving to the right, each circular pulse is emitted from a different position.
Due to the source moving, each pulse will be emitted closer to the right-hand side of the previous pulses, creating a bunching up of the pulses (increase in frequency) in the direction of movement and a spreading out (decrease in frequency) of the pulses in the opposite direction.
This also happens in the classical version of the \hyperlink{def-doppler-effect}{Doppler effect}.
For example, you will notice that an ambulance or police car sounds different when driving towards or away from you due to the bunching up and spreading out of the sound waves in the direction and opposite direction of the moving vehicle.
However, in special relativity, we also must take the \hyperlink{def-time-dilation}{time dilation} of the pulses into account, as there will be a longer time between each subsequential pulse.
This is due to objects moving relative to an observer and therefore having their perceived time moving more slowly.
This is called the second order Doppler effect most notably seen in optical clocks.
This has a decreasing effect on the frequency in all directions.
However, directly in the direction of movement of the source, this is outweighed by the frequency increase from the previous bunching-up effect.
Since the energy of the light is proportional to the frequency, it is also increased in the direction of motion of the source due to the \hyperlink{def-doppler-effect}{Doppler effect}s and decreased in the opposite direction.

One thing not mentioned yet in this picture so far is how the light is also affected by what is called the \hyperlink{def-aberration}{aberration}, which is the change in the angular distribution of the light at each part of the spherical pulses, which will be explained in the next section.

\section{Aberration} \label{sect: Aberration}

Here, we will talk about what the \hyperlink{def-doppler-effect}{Doppler effect} in the previous section has yet to show, which is the effect on the angular distribution of the light in each part of the spherical pulses.
We will show that there is a higher concentration of light in the direction of the source's movement, as shown in Figure (\ref{fig: truck aberrated}).

With the help of the \hyperlink{def-length-contraction}{length contraction} section (\ref{subsect: Length Contraction}), Consider a truck with a spherical mirrored container, with a central bulb emitting light in all directions.
In the \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame} all light reaches the spherical wall \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously} and returns to the center bulb \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneously} as well.
Then in the moving frame, we have the spherical container \hyperlink{def-length-contraction}{length contracted} and the light moving at the same speed but reflecting off the same parts of the walls but at different times, and then returning to the center bulb simultaneously.
For this to be true, the directions of the light must be aberrated (have their direction of propagation changed) in the way shown in the diagram to allow for this \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneous} return to the bulb.

From the diagrams, you can see how light's direction of propagation is changed when emitted or absorbed by a moving source relative to its \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame}, this is called relativistic aberration. The faster the source is moving, the more the direction of each part of the light pulse is changed/aberrated.

% re-word next paragraph

If the speed of a source was to approach the speed of light, all emitted light's propagation direction would approach the direction of movement of the source.
If the source could theoretically reach the speed of light, all light would be emitted in the direction of the source but also move at the same speed.
That is, the source would move with the emitted light, and it would not leave the vicinity of the source.
The rate at which it emits the light would also tend to zero.
If a photon theoretically had mass and its influence of the gravitational force moved at the speed of light, then we would not be able to feel any gravitational effects from this theoretical photon with mass outside its vicinity.
This is due to all its gravitational field being propagated in the direction of its movement and at the same speed as the photon.

Another note is that in astrophysics, it must be taken into account that the Earth's view of the universe is distorted by \hyperlink{def-aberration}{aberration} when looking through telescopes, with the aberrational effect depending on where it is in its rotation around the sun.

We will look at the combination of the Doppler effect and aberration next.

\section{Relativistic Beaming} \label{sect: Intro Relativistic Beaming}

When the Doppler effect and relativistic aberration are taken together, it is known as relativistic beaming.
If we have a source in its \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame} emitting a spherical pulse of light with evenly distributed angles.
Then in a second frame with the source now moving, the Doppler effect has the spherical pulse's wavelength bunched up in the direction of movement (giving a change in the color of the light), with the aberrational effect also giving the angular spread of the light at a higher concentration in the direction of the movement of the source, as shown in figures (\ref{fig: Relativistic Beaming}).

For astrophysics, we need to consider this beaming when looking at distant stars that are moving relative to us so that we can accurately calculate their brightness and the spectrum of light that they are emitting, along with some other things.
We also need to consider that the position we are currently seeing the stars in is their past position due to the delay in light traveling to us on Earth, which is referred to as the retarded position.
We will talk about this next.

\section{A Source's Retarded Vector Field of Light} \label{sect: Retarded Field}

We can make a vector field plot, which is a plot of arrows that shows the position and direction of light in space.
So if we have a source in its rest frame that continually emits pulses of light with a constant time between each pulse, we get what is shown in Figure (\ref{fig: vector field of light source rest frame}).
If we wanted to know what this light vector field looked like in a frame with the source moving, we would need to take into account that the position the source emitted each pulse from is its past position (retarded position).
We also have the dilated time between pulses in this moving frame, so using these and the beaming effect from the previous section we get the light's vector field as shown in Figure (\ref{fig: vector field of light source primed frame}).
From this, we can work out the distribution and, hence, the concentration of the light for any moving source relative to when it is at rest.
If you look closely at the diagrams, you will see the aberrated rings of all the pulses, all with different points from which they were emitted, with them being more compact in the direction of the source's movement.

In particle physics, the photon is the particle that composes light.
It is the carrier of the electromagnetic force between charges.
So how the light's propagation transforms when swapping between frames is necessary to understand electromagnetism, and how the magnetic field comes about for moving sources.
The diagram of the moving source shows you where the source and light currently are.
But, if you were an observer at a particular position in the vector field, you would see the source at its retarded position and not where it currently is, as the light has to travel to you before you see it.
This will be used in the next section to show that you can perceive things moving faster than light, even if they are not.

%Currently, however, you will not be able to find a complete and direct derivation of the electromagnetic force from special relativity and the electric force if you do find one, though you will find quotes in many physics books (such as the Feynman lectures) that the magnetic field is just the relativistic effect applied to the electric field, so if you find a nice derivation I will add it to the math section.

\section{Velocity} \label{sect: (intro) Velocity}

We looked at how velocities at the speed of light change between different frames of reference, that is, how their directions of propagation are rotated (aberrated).
However, for objects moving at velocities slower than that of light, its speed will change in addition to the direction being transformed when swapping between frames.
This is due to us needing the relativistic transform to tend towards the classical \hyperlink{def-transform}{transform} as we look at smaller and smaller speeds of objects.
To understand the general velocity \hyperlink{def-transform}{transformation}, some mathematical detail is needed, so we will need to brush over this for now, and instead look at how the perceived speeds of objects can be more than that of light, even if they are moving slower.

\section{Perceived vs Actual Speed} \label{subsect: Perceived vs Actual Speed}
% REF: relativity visualized book:

Imagine that a ball one light year away (the distance it takes light to travel in a year) is fired directly towards you, as shown in Figure (\ref{fig: perceived vs actual speed}).
It will take one year for the first light from when the ball starts moving to reach you.
If the ball moves at three-quarters of the speed of light, it will hit you in four-thirds of a year (a year and four months) after it is fired.
The last light from the ball will reach you just as the ball hits you.
As you perceive it, the time between the first and last light from the moving ball is four months.
During those four months, you will see the ball start at its initial position and travel a distance of one light-year.
So, to you, the ball appears to have been moving three times faster than light.
This is just how it appears to the \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} due to the delay in the light signal, giving the latency in how the system is observed.

This shows how important it is to consider the delay in the light from objects when observing relativistic systems.
This view is called the delayed/retarded view, meaning what we see now are objects in their past positions, and the further things are from us, the further into the past we are currently seeing them.

%*** could talk about what happens to the quantities without saying why

%This also means that it is impossible to get any particle with mass up to the speed of light, as the closer the particle gets to the speed of light, the heavier it is perceived and, therefore, keeps requiring a greater and greater force to accelerate it, This amount of perceived mass tends to infinity and the force needed to accelerate it would also tend to infinity.\newline

%(diagram)
%If we have two balls roll to the center of a truck at rest and hit each other and stick, giving zero overall momentum as both ball's momentum cancels each other out, but to the observer on the road, the stuck-together balls move with the truck, so the ball at the back of the truck must have more momentum before the collision...
%*** So far, this is also true for classical frame transform

%From before, we have that the consequence of the different times and coordinates is that if a moving object emits light to allow the speed of light to stay constant, the transform will also have the consequence of changing the frequency of the light and hence its energy.

%Since energy is measured in units of position and time (as well as mass), the energy of a particle and systems in different frames have to go through transformations themselves, which leads to the famous energy and mass equivalence equation E = mc2 (this is the reduced form of the equation)\newline

%From finding how the momentum changes between 2 frames due to the Lorentz transformations, we see a relation between the mass of a particle and how much energy this particle is equivalent to. That is, if a particle with a certain mass annihilates with its anti-particle, it gives out photons, corresponding to the energy of the particle, which is different whether it is at rest or moving, as the perceived mass of a particle increases the faster it moves\newline

\section{Summary}\label{sect: Summary chapter 1}

A key early concept was that light traveled through a medium called the luminiferous aether.
The Michelson-Morley experiment attempted to measure Earth's motion relative to this aether.
Surprisingly, no difference was found in the speed of light regardless of direction through this proposed aether.
This conflicted with the intuitive addition of velocities, discredited the aether theory, and led Einstein to propose light's constant speed in all inertial frames of reference as a fundamental principle.

Special relativity emerged from this insight that light's speed in a vacuum is constant for all observers, regardless of the light source's speed relative to each observer.
This required rethinking the concepts of time intervals and distances between points to accommodate light's fixed speed.
This led to the requirement that a clock moving relative to an observer ticks slower from the observer's perspective while also being contracted in the direction of its motion.
This was shown in Figure (\ref{fig: truck clock}) and Figure (\ref{fig: full truck transform}).
The faster an object moves relative to an observer, the more its length contracts and its time dilates to the observer.

It also led to the \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneity} of events not being absolute.
For example, light emitted from the middle of a moving truck reaches the front and back walls simultaneously for an observer at rest in the truck.
But an observer standing still on the road sees the light hit both walls at different times, as shown in Figure (\ref{fig: truck simultaneity}).
There is no universal "now" at a distance-observers relate times of events differently.
It is only events that happen simultaneously at the same location that happen simultaneously in all frames of reference.

Classical physics is verified by our day-to-day experience, though this does not reflect the full reality, as relativistic effects only become readily noticeable at speeds close to that of light.
With the speed of light being 300 million meters per second, astronomically faster than what occurs in our daily experience.

When it comes to velocities, they combine differently than in classical physics.
However, we must ensure that the transforms reduce to the intuitive addition of velocities of classical physics at low speeds while accommodating light's constant rate in all frames of reference.
This leads to initially bizarre outcomes such as \textbf{apparent} faster-than-light motion emerging from how relativistic optical effects play out across distances, which is due to the delay in light signals from objects at a distance.
Nevertheless, special relativity gives a truer, more accurate picture of reality.

Due to space-time effects on wave propagation, we also have seen that the emitted light's frequencies shift (Doppler effect) for a moving source, and that light is concentrated in the direction of the source's motion (aberrational effect).
Together, both intensely focus light in the direction of rapidly moving objects, giving relativistic beaming.

These effects will all be explained more fully with math in the coming chapters, along with other effects that require the math to fully understand, as well as new energy, mass, and momentum conservation laws.
We will derive everything step by step, starting with the transformation of positions and times between reference frames.

\chapter{Position, Time and Velocity} \label{ch: Position, Time and Velocity} %The Math Begins:

Now that we have learned about the concepts of special relativity, we can use them and let the mathematics begin.
Starting with classical relativity, which will give us an understanding of how to \hyperlink{def-transform}{transform} coordinates between \hyperlink{def-Reference-frame}{reference frame}s.
This will give us something to compare special relativity to later, and help with our intuition.

What we learn here will be directly used in all of the following chapters, to derive more of the foundational concepts of the theory.
As everything else is all built upon this chapter, which is about how the positions and times are transformed between two inertial frames to allow the speed of light to stay constant.

In this chapter, we will start with how swapping between two inertial frames works classically.
Then using the two assumed facts, the postulates, that are used as the basis of reasoning for special relativity, we will find out how to swap between frames in special relativity, by following the train of thought that we did in the previous conceptual chapter.
By first deriving the time dilation, and length contraction equations in order to then find the full transform of the space and time coordinates between two inertial frames.
We will come across a very useful quantity which we will denote with a ${\gamma}$, this quantity will be used throughout this book to simplify equations.
After this, we will look at the transform for infinitesimal changes in distances and use this to derive how velocities and accelerations change when swapping between two inertial frames.
By the end of this chapter, you will understand the coordinate transforms conceptually and mathematically when swapping between two frames, and how to derive the velocity and acceleration transforms.

\section{Classical Relativity} \label{sect: Classical Relativity}

Classical (Galilean) relativity was the earlier theory of how to transform coordinates in different inertial frames.

It was based on two assumptions, which are that \textbf{in each frame, you would observe the following:}

\begin{itemize}
	\item The distance between objects is the same.
	\item Time flows at the same rate, giving the same time for an event in each frame.
\end{itemize}

Before special relativity, it was assumed that distances between two points were the same for all \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s.
That is, the first \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} would see a stick and measure it to be the same length as another \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} who is moving relative to the first.
The other assumption is that the flow of time is the same for everyone.
That is, clocks move at the same rate for each \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} and if, say, a particle was to emit light at a particular time, this light would be emitted at the same time for all \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s.

For classical relativity, if we have the positions and times of a particle's motion relative to one observer in their frame, and we want to find the motion of the particle relative to a second observer who is moving at constant velocity relative to the first.
We need to know how to transform these into this second observer's frame.
That is, if we have how one \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} would describe the coordinates of a particle over time relative to them and we want to now know the coordinates of the particle with respect to the other \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}, we need to know how the transformation of coordinates works.

So let us see how the mathematics works for the classical coordinate system transform between two inertial observers frames, by looking at the coordinates of an event in an initial reference frame with a second inertial frame's coordinate axis moving relative to the initial frame's, illustrated in Figure (\ref{fig: simple Galilean transform derivation}):

An event ${\vec{E}}$ in this initial frame is described by a set of spatial and time coordinates ${\underline{r}} = ({x},{y},{z})$ and ${t}$.

We also show ${\vec{O'E}}$ which represents the vector from the primed axis origin to the event in the initial frame.}

As shown in the diagram, we are in the initial frame with origin ${O}$ defined by coordinates $(0,0,0)$ and the primed frame is moving in the z-direction at velocity ${v}$ such that the position of the primed origin relative to the initial frame's axis is

\begin{equation}
	\vec{OO{'}} = (0,0,{v}{t})
\end{equation}

at time ${t}$ from when the origins overlapped.
If there is an \hyperlink{def-event}{event} at position

\begin{equation}
	\underline{r} = ({x},{y},{z})
\end{equation}

the event is described by

\begin{equation}
	\vec{E} = ({x},{y},{z},{t})
\end{equation}

then in the primed frame, we will have the event described by the primed coordinates that we want to transform into, as

\begin{equation}
	\vec{E{'}} = ({x{'}},{y{'}},{z{'}},t{'})
\end{equation}

To swap into the primed frame's coordinates, we need to recall from the previous assumptions that distances and times are conserved, and therefore the length and directions of all the vectors between ${O}$, ${O'}$ and ${E}$ are the same in each frame, and time flows at the same rate (${t'} = {t}$), from this knowledge and Figure (\ref{fig: simple Galilean transform derivation}) we have the event's coordinates described in the primed frame by its coordinate axis as

\begin{equation}
	{\underline{r}{'}} = ({x{'}},{y{'}},{z{'}}) = \underline{r}-\vec{OO{'}} = ({x},{y},{z}-{v}{t})
	\label{eq: classical event}
\end{equation}

This gives us the full description of the position and time \hyperlink{def-transform}{transform} for an \hyperlink{def-event}{event} as

\begin{equation}
	\mhl{
		\begin{aligned}
			 & {x{'}} = {x}        \\
			 & {y{'}} = {y}        \\
			 & {z{'}} = {z}-{v}{t} \\
			\text{at time \ \ \ }  \\
			 & {t{'}}= {t}
		\end{aligned}
	}
	\label{eq: Galilean transformation}
\end{equation}

These are the equations that define classical relativity, we can compare this to the equations of the coordinate transforms in special relativity later. They define the event's position relative to whichever frame that we are in's axis. The special relativistic equations later will look similar to these, but with an extra factor in the z-component and with the time will no longer be consistent in both frames.

We can also write the initial frame's event coordinates in terms of the primed coordinates, by rearranging the transformation equations giving the inverse transform as

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		 & {x} = {x{'}}             \\
		 & {y} = {y{'}}             \\
		 & {z} = {z{'}} + {v}{t{'}} \\
		\text{at time \ \ \ }       \\
		 & {t} = {t{'}}
	\end{aligned}
	\label{eq: Inverse Galilean transformation}
\end{equation}

So the inverse transformation, going from \hyperlink{def-Primed-Frame}{primed frame} to original is just a matter of swapping all primed and initial coordinates and changing the sign on the \hyperlink{def-frame-velocity}{frame velocity}
This can be seen at time ${t} = 0$ when we have the frame's origins overlapping and there is a symmetry from here, as we have the freedom to choose either frame to be the original, as no frame is particularly special and depending on which one you pick the relative velocity is either ${v}$ or-${v}$. We will have the same rules in special relativity later on when we want to get the inverse transform.

You might have noticed that the direction of the second frame is in the upward z-direction instead of being to the right in the case of the truck diagrams from the previous chapter, this is to help us when we use spherical polar coordinates later and to help see the symmetries. But that is a couple of chapters away, for now we will look at the assumptions of special relativity and their consequences, which we will then apply to the same notion of an event that we have in the Figure (\ref{fig: simple Galilean transform derivation}).

\section{Postulates of Special Relativity} \label{sect: Postulates of Special Relativity}

For classical relativity, we started with two assumptions. It turns out that these assumptions need to be thrown away, as they contradict the experimental evidence that the speed of light is constant for every observer and frame. We replace them with two new assumptions, called the \textbf{postulates of special relativity:}

\begin{mainpoints}
	\item The speed of light in a \hyperlink{def-vacuum}{vacuum} is the same in all inertial/non-accelerating frames of reference.
	\item The laws of physics and outcome of experiments are the same in all \hyperlink{def-Inertial-reference-frame}{inertial frames of reference}. If an observer in an inertial reference frame carries out an experiment, they would find the same result if they had carried it out within a different inertial frame instead.
\end{mainpoints}

The first postulate here will be the most important to us in deriving the transform equations of special relativity and will be used to show how time is dilated/slowed down for moving objects. The second postulate has a consequence that if events happen simultaneously at an overlapping position in one frame, then they will also happen simultaneously in an overlapping position in any other inertial frame.
We will now use these assumptions with the concept of a light clock to show the effect of length contraction.

\section{Time Dilation} \label{sect: Time Dilation}

Time passes more slowly for things moving relative to you, this is called time dilation.
To explain why it happens we will use the simple concept of a light clock.
It consists of light bouncing between two mirrors.
It keeps time by measuring when light returns to the first mirror, counting it as one tick of its clock, as shown in Figure (\ref{fig: light clock}).

In this second frame, there is a distance ${u}{\Delta t{'}}$ between where the light was initially reflected by the left mirror and where it returned to it. For this, the light had to travel a total diagonal distance of ${c}{\Delta t{'}}$ to return, were ${\Delta\tau}$ is the time for the return journey in the primed frame.}
	\label{fig: light clock}
\end{figure}
%███████████

The light in the clock, takes a time ${\Delta\tau}$ in the clock's rest frame to make the return journey.
We can see from Figure (\ref{fig: light clock rest frame}) that in the rest frame, the distance the light travels to the mirror and back in this time is

\begin{equation}
	2{L} = {c}{\Delta\tau}.
\end{equation}

The distance the mirrors move during this return journey in the moving frame is

\begin{equation}
	{u}{\Delta t{'}} =-{v} {\Delta t{'}},
\end{equation}

where ${\Delta t{'}}$ is the time it took light to return in the moving frame and ${u}$ is the speed of the light clock, which is in the opposite direction of the movement of the \hyperlink{def-Primed-Frame}{primed frame} relative to the \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame}, that is ${u} =-{v}$.

The distance light travels in this time is

\begin{equation}
	{c}{\Delta t{'}}
\end{equation}

This is the hypotenuse of a right-angled triangle formed by ${u}{\Delta t{'}}=-{v}{\Delta t{'}}$ and $2{L}$, so we have the square of the hypotenuse equal to the square of the other two lengths:

\begin{equation}
	{c}^2 {\Delta t{'}}^2 = {v}^2 {\Delta t{'}}^2 + {c}^2{\Delta\tau}^2
\end{equation}

rearranging to find the time it took in the \hyperlink{def-Primed-Frame}{primed frame} relative to the \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame}, we find

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: time dilation}
	{\Delta t{'}}^2 = {\Delta\tau}^2 + \frac{{v}^2}{c^2} {\Delta t{'}}^2
	{\Delta t{'}} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{{v}^2}{{c}^2}}} {\Delta\tau} = {\gamma} {\Delta\tau}
\end{equation}

with

\begin{equation}
	{\gamma} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{{v}^2}{{c}^2}}}.
\end{equation}

This factor, ${\gamma}$, is used throughout special relativity to simplify equations.
We can see from the diagram and the equations, that the time for the return journey in the frame with the clock moving is longer relative to its rest frame,

\begin{equation}
	{\Delta t{'}} \geq {\Delta\tau}
\end{equation}

We take this outcome as the time taken between two \hyperlink{def-event}{event}s at the same position in the moving frame takes longer than in the \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame} of the clock, due to the longer distance light must travel at the same speed.
Hence systems that are moving seem to have there time flowing slower.
One example of this, is that unstable particles that are moving faster have longer livespans before they decay.

\section{Length Contraction} \label{sect: Length Contraction}

*** $L$ is used later on for lights propagated length

An object's size gets smaller in the direction of movement compared to when it is at rest, this is called length contraction.
To explain why it happens we will add a second perpendicular light path to previous section's experimental setup.
So there is now light moving perpendicular as well as parallel the primed frame's movement, as shown in Figure (\ref{fig: length contraction math})

	\caption{\textbf{Light paths showing the need for length contraction.} A central orange bulb emits light in two directions, with all light being reflected by the mirrors back to reach the central bulb simultaneously. This is shown at rest, fig (a), and in another inertial frame with the system now moving at speed ${u}$, fig (b), with its length now having to be contracted in the direction of movement to allow for the simultaneous return of light to the bulb. The length between the bulb and front mirror is shown as ${\Delta L}$ and ${\Delta L'}$ in each frame. The paths the light took to the front mirror ${l_1}$ and back ${l_2}$ are shown in the rest frame with the corresponding paths ${l'_1}$ and ${l'_2}$ in the moving frame.}
	\label{fig: length contraction math}
\end{figure}

If we have a system as described in Figure (\ref{fig: length contraction math}).
Then since the light returns simultaneously in the rest frame, we need the light to also return simultaneously in the second frame.
Multiple events that happen at a single point simultaneously in one frame, must happen simultaneously at a single point in all other frames.
This is to allow for the second postulate to hold true.
The time between the light being emitted and absorbed will be the dilated time that we worked out in the previous section.
This can be seen as the sideways light path in this and the light clock's setup from previous section is the same path.
In the moving frame, to achieve this simultaneity in the return of the light to the bulb, the length of the full path of light from the central bulb to the front mirror and back ($2 {\Delta L'} = {l'_1} + {l'_2}$) must be the same as the perpendicular path, due to the speed of light being the same for both paths.
We can work out the length of the sideways paths from the time dilation section, ${c}{\Delta t'}$, and this is the length the total path needs to be in the forward directions as well.
We will find that the paths can only have this length, if the distance between the bulb and the front mirror is contracted in the direction of movement.
Note that there can not be a contraction in the perpendicular direction to the movement due to the paradox explained in Figure (\ref{fig: width contraction}).

In the moving frame, the pulse sent forward has a path length equal to the speed of light times the time taken for the path.
Which is also equal to the primed frame's distance between the bulb and mirror plus the distance the mirror has moved away from the point it was emitted in this time, that is

\begin{equation}
	{l'_1} = {c}{\Delta t'_1} = {\Delta  L'} + {u} {\Delta t'_1}
\end{equation}

where ${u}$ is the speed that the front mirror is moving away from the point it was emitted, ${\Delta t'_1}$ is the time taken to get to the mirror, and ${\Delta  L'}$ is the distance between the bulb and the mirror in front in the primed frame.
After reaching the mirror, the light then must travel back to the bulb a distance

\begin{equation}
	{l'_2} = {c} {\Delta t'_2} = {\Delta  L'} - {u} {\Delta t'_2}.
\end{equation}

Where ${\Delta t'_2}$ is the time taken to return to the bulb from the front mirror, with the source moving towards the reflected light.

Both of these give the two times as

\begin{equation}
	{\Delta t'_1} = \frac{\Delta  L'}{{c} - {u}}
\end{equation}

and

\begin{equation}
	{\Delta t'_2} = \frac{{\Delta  L'}}{{c} + {u}}.
\end{equation}

Adding both these times together gives the total dilated time of return as

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		{\Delta t{'}} & \color{gray} = {\Delta  L'}(\frac{1}{{c} + {u}} + \frac{1}{{c} - {u}}) \\
		              & \color{gray} = \frac{\Delta  L'}{c}\frac{2}{1- {u}^2/{c}^2}            \\
		              & =  2{\gamma}^2 \frac{\Delta  L'}{c}
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

where we used ${u}=-{v}$ and then the ${\gamma}$ factor to simplfy equation.
Now from this and using the time dilation equation, we have

\begin{equation}
	{c}{\Delta t{'}} = {c}{\gamma} {\Delta t} = 2{\gamma} {\Delta L} = 2{\gamma}^2 {\Delta  L'}
\end{equation}

Finally, this leads to the length from the bulb to the front mirror in the primed frame to be

\begin{equation}
	{\Delta  L'} = \frac{1}{{\gamma}}{\Delta  L}.
\end{equation}

This means that for a system moving relative to an observer, the distances for the system in the direction of movement are contracted compared to the rest frame of the object, that is

\begin{equation}
	{\Delta  L'} \leq {\Delta  L}.
\end{equation}

Objects and the distance between them are therefore shorter in a frame with them moving compared to in the rest frame of the objects.

With this knowledge and the last section, we can now derive the coordinate transform equations.

\section{Position and Time Transformation} \label{sect: Position and Time Transformation}

In the last two sections we have looked at the dilation between two different times at the same location and the contraction between two different positions at the same time, when we swap between frames.
Now we will use both these concepts to help us see how the combination of the time and the position coordinate, known as an event, transforms when we swap frames.
For the derivation of the coordinate transformation of an event between two inertial frames, we will be starting with the same diagram as we had in the classical relativity in Section (\ref{sect: Classical Relativity}) and apply what we have learned from the time dilation and length contraction sections so that we can be consistent with the postulates of special relativity.
This will allow us to derive the coordinate transformation equations, known as the Lorentz transformation.

\end{equation}

Then the displacement between the initial frame's origin and the event's position in the initial frame is

\begin{equation}
	\underline{r} = ({x},{y},{z})
\end{equation}

and displacement between the primed frame's origin and the event's coordinates in the initial frame is

\begin{equation}
	\vec{O'E} = ({x},{y},{z}-{v}{t})
\end{equation}

In the primed frame, we will have the event described by the primed coordinates that we want to transform into, as

\begin{equation}
	\vec{E}' = ({x{'}},{y{'}},{z{'}},t{'})
\end{equation}

with the displacement between the primed frame's origin and the event's position in the primed frame given as

\begin{equation}
	{\underline{r}{'}} = ({x{'}},{y{'}},{z{'}})
\end{equation}

These are just the position coordinates of the event in the primed frame.

The primed frame's axis and coordinates are moving relative to the initial frame, so from the previous length contraction section we would have the displacement between the primed axis origin and the event in the initial frame $\vec{O'E}$, length contracted, in the $z$-direction, compared to the primed position coordinates in the primed frame ${\underline{r}{'}}$, that is

\begin{equation}
	\vec{O'E} = ({x},{y},{z}-{v}{t}) = ({x{'}},{y{'}},\frac{z{'}}{\gamma})
\end{equation}

The $x$ and $y$-components are unaffected, with the paradox of it they were effected, explained in Figure (\ref{fig: width contraction}).
Rearranging for the $z$-component, we have

\begin{equation}
	({x{'}},{y{'}},{z{'}}) = {\underline{r}{'}} = ({x},{y},{\gamma}({z}-{v}{t}) )
\end{equation}

There is a symmetry between the frames because if we were originally in the primed frame we would have the initial frame moving instead at -${v}$ in the z-direction relative to the primed frame, and we could follow the above steps starting with this and the primed coordinate instead, and find the inverse \hyperlink{def-transform}{transformation} is the same apart from it replaces each frame's coordinates with the other and has the negative of the previous frame velocity instead.
That is

\begin{equation}
	({x},{y},{z}) = {\underline{r}} = ({x{'}},{y{'}},{\gamma}({z{'}}+{v}{t{'}}) )
\end{equation}

We can substitute both $z$-coordinate transforms into each other to find the time transform

\begin{equation}
	{z} = {\gamma} ( {\gamma} ({z}-{v}{t}) + {v}{t{'}})
\end{equation}

and rearranging gives

\begin{equation}
	{t{'}} = {\gamma} \left( \left( \dfrac{1}{{\gamma}^2}-1 \right)\frac{z}{v} + t \right)
\end{equation}

with $1/{\gamma}^{2} = 1-{v}^2/{c}^2$ leading to the primed frames time for the event given in initial frames coordinates as

\begin{equation}
	{t{'}} = {\gamma} \left( t-\dfrac{{v}{z}}{{c}^2} \right)
\end{equation}

again if we want the inverse transform from primed to initial frame we can swap the primed and initial frame coordinates and put an extra minus in front of the frame velocity.

\begin{equation}
	{t} = {\gamma} \left( t{'}+\dfrac{{v}{z{'}}}{{c}^2} \right)
\end{equation}

We now have the full description of the transformation of the position and time of an \hyperlink{def-event}{event} as

\begin{equation}
	\mhl{
		\begin{aligned}
			 & {x{'}} = x                                           \\
			 & {y{'}} = y                                           \\
			 & {z{'}} = {\gamma} ({z}-{v}{t})                       \\
			\text{at time \ \ \ }                                   \\
			 & {t{'}} = {\gamma} \bigg(t-\frac{{v}{z}}{{c}^2}\bigg) \\
			 & \text{from the overlap of coordinate axis. \ \ \ }   \\
			\text{with \ \ \ }                                      \\
			 & {\gamma} = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{1-\frac{{v}^2}{{c}^2}}}
		\end{aligned}
	}
	\label{eq: Lorentz transformation}
\end{equation}

These are the equations that define special relativity, They allow us to find an event's position relative to whichever frame that we want to swap into's axis.

In the time \hyperlink{def-transform}{transform} equation the $\frac{{v}{z}}{{c}^2}$ term is the cause of the \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneity} of \hyperlink{def-event}{event}s at two different positions in one inertial frame no longer being \hyperlink{def-simultaneity}{simultaneous} in another inertial frame, and the ${\gamma}$ factor, is the term that causes the overall change in how fast time flows at a point relative to the initial frame.
In the spatial coordinate transform equations the ${v}{t}$ factor is due to both axes' origins moving away from each other and the ${\gamma}$ factor is the cause of the change of lengths in the direction of the frame's movement.

We can see how points representing the coordinates in an initial frame look like in a primed frame of reference, by looking at Figure (\ref{fig: coordinate transform}).

\end{figure}
%███████████

This diagram shows stationary points representing coordinates in the initial frame.
In the primed frame, these points are transformed to the position ${z{'}} = {\gamma} {z}$ and are now moving at speed $-{v}$, they are transformed using the transformation equations to points that are more spread out in the primed frame, but the times they are located at each of these points are different, they have desynchronized times.
Therefore, to find these points, which represent the coordinates in the initial frame, now in the primed frame at the synchronized time of ${t{'}} = 0$, we must propagate the points to that time, which ends up being ${z{'}} = \frac{{z}}{{\gamma}}$, as shown in figure (\ref{fig: coordinate transform subfig_3}).

This figure is to give you a little bit more intuition on how the coordinates and swapping between frames work.
We will later see a more natural interpretation of the coordinate transforms when we introduce the notion of retarded time in Chapter (\ref{ch: Observers Delayed Worldview}), which will give us another reason for why the time transformation is the way it is.

\subsection{Transforms with Small Primed Frame Velocity} \label{subsect: Transforms with Slow Primed Frame Velocity}

If we have the primed frame velocity much smaller than the speed of light, ($v \ll c$), then we have ${v}/{c}\approx 0$ and therefore $\gamma \approx 1$.
Hence, we get back the previous classical transform equations

\begin{equation}
	{t{'}} \approx t
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	z{'} \approx {z}-{v}{t}
\end{equation}

Which is the expected result, as it agrees with the everyday observations we are used to seeing at these speeds.
That is, no noticeable difference in times on clocks or lengths of moving objects.
We can see when the $\gamma$-factor's influence starts to become significant from Figure (\ref{fig: Gamma Factor}).

\end{figure}
%███████████

As can be seen, it is not until around when the primed frame velocity is a third of the speed of light, that it significantly differs from being equal to 1.
This is a speed unattainable to us, the only thing we can bring up close to this speed is particles, and nothing human made is even a 1000th the speed of light.

\subsection{Space and Time Intervals} \label{subsect: Space and Time Intervals}

To get the velocity transform equations we will first need the equations to transform the displacement between two positions and the interval between times, then take them in the limit as the changes go to zero.
That is, when we have infinitesimal changes of coordinates.
If we want to know how the displacement between two coordinates ${\vec{R}_1} = (x_1,y_1,z_1)$ and ${\vec{R}_2} = (x_2,y_2,z_2)$ transforms, we can take the difference of the transforms of both the coordinates as follows

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		 & {x{'}}_2-{x{'}}_1 = x_2-x_1                                                                                         \\
		 & {y{'}}_2-{y{'}}_1 = y_2-y_1                                                                                         \\
		 & z{'}_2-z{'}_1 = {\gamma} ( z_2- {v} {t}_2)-{\gamma} ( z_1- {v} {t}_1)                                               \\
		 & {t{'}}_2-t{'}_1 = {\gamma} \bigg( {t}_2-\frac{v}{{c}^2} z_2 \bigg)-{\gamma} \bigg( {t}_1-\frac{v}{{c}^2} z_1 \bigg)
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

rearranging and replacing the difference of the first and second of each coordinate with ${\Delta}{\vec{R}} = ({\Delta}x,{\Delta}y,{\Delta}z) = (x_2-x_1,y_2-y_1,z_2-z_1)$, giving the displacement transform as

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: interval of Coordinates}
	\begin{aligned}
		 & \Delta x{'} = {\Delta x}                                                   \\
		 & \Delta {y{'}} = {\Delta y}                                                 \\
		 & \Delta {z{'}} = {\gamma} ( {\Delta z}- {v} \Delta t)                       \\
		 & {\Delta t{'}} = {\gamma} \bigg( \Delta t-\frac{v}{{c}^2} {\Delta z} \bigg)
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

This is the same form as the original coordinate transform equations.

From these equations, we can also get the differential quantities when we take infinitesimal changes, which give the same form again, as

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: infinitesimal interval of Coordinates}
	\begin{aligned}
		 & {dx{'}} = {dx}                                        \\
		 & {dy{'}} = {dy}                                        \\
		 & {dz{'}} = {\gamma} (dz- {v}dt)                        \\
		 & {dt{'}} = {\gamma} \bigg(dt-\frac{v}{{c}^2} dz \bigg)
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

So when we make an infinitesimally small change in position and/or time within a frame, we know what the corresponding change is in a primed frame, we will use these to get the velocity transform equations.
As velocity at any instance is the infinitesimal change in position per infinitesimal change in time.
These will also be used later to find, invariant quantities, quantities that remain the same in each frame.
For example, the space-time interval and the energy-momentum relationship in Chapter (\ref{ch: Invariant Quantities}).

\section{Velocity} \label{sect: Velocity}

The velocity at any instant is the infinitesimal change in position over the infinitesimal change in time $\frac{d\vec{R}}{dt}$.
So using the infinitesimals from Equation \eqref{eq: infinitesimal interval of Coordinates}, we get the velocity in each direction as

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		 & u'_x = \frac{dx{'}}{dt{'}} = \frac{dx}{{\gamma} \bigg(dt-\frac{vdz}{{c}^2}\bigg) }                    \\
		 & u'_y = \frac{dy{'}}{dt{'}} = \frac{dy}{{\gamma} \bigg(dt-\frac{vdz}{{c}^2}\bigg) }                    \\
		 & u'_z = \frac{dz{'}}{dt{'}} = \frac{{\gamma} (dz - {v}dt)}{{\gamma} \bigg(dt-\frac{vdz}{{c}^2}\bigg) }
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

now dividing the top and bottom of the fraction on the right hand side by ${dt}$ we can give the equations in their vector form as

\begin{equation}
	\mhl{
		\begin{aligned}
			 & \underline{u}{'} = \dfrac{1}{{\gamma}\left(1-\dfrac{v}{{c}^2} {u_z}\right) }
			\begin{pmatrix}
				u_x                               \\
				u_y                               \\
				{\gamma} \left( u_z - {v} \right) \\
			\end{pmatrix}
			\\
			 & \text{at position ${\underline{r}{'}}$ and time ${t{'}}$ }
		\end{aligned}
	}
	\label{eq: velocity transform}
\end{equation}

This is used to find the velocity of anything in another frame at the corresponding primed position and time.
We will put this equation to work in a later section when we look at how the light emitted from a source particle has its velocity direction changed/aberrated and the effect this has on its intensity in all directions. Next, we will use this to get the acceleration transform.

\textbf{Side note:}

For those interested; The generalized velocity \hyperlink{def-transform}{transform} (which we will not derive here) for a frame velocity in any direction and not just the z-direction is

\begin{equation}
	\underline{u}{'} = \dfrac{1}{{\gamma}} \dfrac{\underline{u} + \Big[\dfrac{{\gamma}-1}{\|\underline{v}\|^2}(\underline{u}\cdot \underline{v})-{\gamma} \Big] \underline{v}}{1-\dfrac{\underline{u}\cdot\underline{v}}{{c}^2}}
\end{equation}

with ${\underline{v}}$ being the frame's velocity in any generalized direction.

\section{Acceleration} \label{sect: Acceleration}

To find how the acceleration (known as the 3-acceleration) of a particle transforms for \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer}s in two different frames, we take the differential of the velocity \hyperlink{def-transform}{transform} in equation \eqref{eq: velocity transform} and use the differentiation rules for two generic functions ${f}$ and ${g}$: ${d(gf)} = {f} {dg} + {g} {df}$, and ${d[{{f}({g}(x))}]} = {{dg}(x)} * {df({{g}(x)})}$

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		d\underline{u}{'} & \color{gray} = \dfrac{1}{{\gamma}\left(1-\dfrac{v}{{c}^2} {u_z}\right) }
		\begin{pmatrix}
			d{u_x}          \\
			d{u_y}          \\
			{\gamma} d{u_z} \\
		\end{pmatrix}
		+ \dfrac{{\gamma} \dfrac{v}{{c}^2} d{u_z}}{{\gamma}^2\left(1-\dfrac{v}{{c}^2} {u_z}\right)^2 }
		\begin{pmatrix}
			{u_x}                              \\
			{u_y}                              \\
			{\gamma} \left( {u_z}- {v} \right) \\
		\end{pmatrix}                                                           \\
		                  & \color{gray} = ...
		\\
		                  & = \dfrac{1}{{\gamma}\left(1-\dfrac{v}{{c}^2} {u_z}\right)^2 }
		\begin{pmatrix}
			d{u_x} + \frac{v}{{c}^2}( {u_x} d{u_z}-{u_z} d{u_x}) \\
			d{u_y} + \frac{v}{{c}^2}( {u_y} d{u_z}-{u_z} d{u_y}) \\
			\frac{1}{{\gamma}} d{u_z}                            \\
		\end{pmatrix}
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Now, divide by ${dt{'}}$ as we did for the velocity in the previous section, and we get the acceleration transform as

\begin{equation}
	\mhl{
		\begin{aligned}
			 & \underline{a}{'} = \dfrac{1}{{\gamma}^2\left(1-\dfrac{v}{{c}^2} {u_z}\right)^3 }
			\begin{pmatrix}
				{{a}_{x}} + \frac{v}{{c}^2}({u_x} {{a}_{z}}-{u_z} {{a}_{x}}) \\
				{{a}_{y}} + \frac{v}{{c}^2}({u_y} {{a}_{z}}-{u_z} {{a}_{y}}) \\
				\frac{1}{{\gamma}} {{a}_{z}}                                 \\
			\end{pmatrix}
			\\
			 & \text{at position ${\underline{r}{'}}$ and time ${t{'}}$ }
		\end{aligned}
	}
	\label{eq: acceleration transform}
\end{equation}

So if we know how a particle accelerates in one frame we will know its corresponding acceleration in another frame at the corresponding primed time and position.

\textbf{Side note:}

Again for those interested; The generalized acceleration \hyperlink{def-transform}{transform} (which we will not derive here) for a frame velocity in any direction and not just the z-direction is

\begin{equation}
	\underline{a{'}} = \frac{1}{{\gamma} ^3 \left(1-\frac{(\underline{u}\cdot \underline{v})}{{c}^2}\right)^3}\left[ {\gamma} \left(1-\frac{(\underline{u}\cdot\underline{v})}{{c}^2}\right)\underline{a} + \frac{{\gamma} (\underline{a}\cdot\underline{v})}{{c}^2}\underline{u} + (1-{\gamma} ) (\underline{a}\cdot\hat{\underline{v}}) \cdot\hat{\underline{v}}\right]
\end{equation}

at position ${\underline{r}{'}}$ and time ${t{'}}$

This is the 3-acceleration, not to be confused with the 4-acceleration that will be mentioned in a later chapter, which is a more abstract quantity.

\section{Summary}\label{sect: Summary chapter 2}

In this chapter, we derived the mathematics for the transformation of the spatial and time coordinates for classical relativity to help us, later, understand the derivation of special relativity.
We then introduced the assumptions, known as the postulates of special relativity, which we use to derive how time slows down due to time dilation, and how lengths of moving objects get smaller due to length contraction.
This introduced us to $\gamma$, which is a factor used throughout relativity to simplify equations.
From this we had the tools to derive the transformation equations, which in turn allowed us to calculate the velocity and acceleration transforms.

So we have learnt how to transform from one reference frame into another, in special relativity.
The outline of steps to transform a system of particles and their properties such as position, time, velocity and acceleration are as follows.
If you have a system of particles in an initial frame, and you want to transform their positions to a new frame, you need to first define where this initial axis' origin is.
You are free to choose where it is.
The primed frame's axis will overlap with this initial frame's axis at your arbitrarily chosen starting time, that is when you define the time as ${t}=0$ (the time of the overlap is also ${t{'}}=0$ in the primed frame).
You can now transform the positions into the primed frame.
These particles have these primed frame positions at the calculated primed frame times, defined in Equations \eqref{eq: Lorentz transformation}.
To transform the velocities and acceleration of these particles at their primed frame positions at the corresponding primed times in the primed frame, you can use equations \eqref{eq: acceleration transform} and \eqref{eq: velocity transform}.

And this is all the steps that are needed, but an easy mistake to make is to forget that ${t}$ and ${t{'}}$ are the times from the overlap of the frame origins, in their respective frames.

So, this chapter shows the foundations of special relativity, but there is still more to come.
Before we go further though, we will take a look at the delayed view of the world an observer sees, due to the delay in light from their surrounding.
This will help us understand why we need the time transformation to be the way it is.

\chapter{Observers Delayed Worldview} \label{ch: Observers Delayed Worldview}

Light travels extremely fast compared to other everyday speeds we are used to, roughly at 300,000,000 meters per second.
In the blink of an eye, light could travel around the world twice.
So we do not need to normally worry about the delay in the light signal, as the time to propagate the distances in our everyday world is extremely short, so the signal can be approximated as being instantaneous, ignoring the more complex modeling of the delayed light signal.
But when it comes to particle physics or astronomy, we might be dealing with speeds close to that of light or huge distances.
For example, light has taken 152,000 years to travel from the Andromeda Galaxy, so we are currently seeing the Andromeda Galaxy where it was and how it looked 152,000 years ago.
These past positions that we currently see are called the delayed view/\hyperlink{def-retarded-position}{retarded} positions.
The topic in this chapter is not normally included in Special relativity texts, but it is needed to give you a more full story and understanding of relativity.
This comes with extra insights into the reason for why the coordinate transform equations have to be the way that they are.
As we will see when transforming retarded positions between frames.

\section{Retarded Coordinates} \label{sect: Retarded Coordinates}

In an initial frame we have its own coordinates at rest.
If a light signal is emitted from a coordinate to an observer at the origin, it takes time to reach them, so the observer would see this stationary coordinate at the previous time that the light was emitted from this coordinate, this is the coordinate's retarded time.

%We will separate out the coordinate which we attach to the coordinate system and the position of the object which moves independently of the coordinate system, but which we describe relative to the coordinate system.

%███████████

As shown in the diagram, if we take the \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame} of an \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} and a source that emits a pulse of light from its position at ${\underline{r}}$ so that it is received by the \hyperlink{def-observer}{observer} at the origin, at time ${t} = 0$.
The retarded time the pulse of light was emitted is

\begin{equation}
	{{t}_{ret}} =-\frac{\|\underline{r}\|}{c},
\end{equation}

which is the negative of the time it took for light to propagate along ${\underline{r}}$ to the origin.
The velocity of the light that propagated to the origin is

\begin{equation}
	\underline{c} = {c}
	\begin{pmatrix}
		0            \\
		\sin{\alpha} \\
		\cos{\alpha} \\
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

Were ${\alpha}$ is the direction of propagation.
This and the retarded time (which is negative) gives the retarded position the light was emitted from as

\begin{equation}
	\underline{r}_{ret} = -\|\underline{r}\|\hat{c} ={c}{{{t}_{ret}}}
	\begin{pmatrix}
		0            \\
		\sin{\alpha} \\
		\cos{\alpha} \\
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

The source's position and retarded position are the same in the rest frame as the source is not moving.
Also, the position vector and light's velocity vector are in opposite directions, The emitted time being negative flips the direction of the velocity vector here.
Now inputting this retarded position and time into the coordinate transform we get the retarded position and time in the primed frame as

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\underline{r}'_{ret}     & = {c}{{t}_{ret}}
		\begin{pmatrix}
			0                                                \\
			\sin{\alpha}                                     \\
			{\gamma} \left( \cos{\alpha}-\frac{v}{c} \right) \\
		\end{pmatrix}
		=
		\begin{pmatrix}
			0                                             \\
			{y}                                           \\
			{\gamma} \left( {z}-{v} {{{t}_{ret}}} \right) \\
		\end{pmatrix}
		\\
		\text{at retarded time } &
		\\ {{t}'_{ret}} & = {\gamma} \left(1-\frac{v}{c} \cos{\alpha} \right) {{{t}_{ret}}}
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

If instead we use the angle of the retarded coordinate from the z-axis, $\theta_{ret} = \alpha - \pi$, we have that $\cos{\alpha}=\cos{(\theta_{ret}+\pi)}=-\cos{\theta_{ret}}$ and therefor the retarded time can be given as

\begin{equation}
	\\ {{t}'_{ret}} = {\gamma} \left(1 + \frac{v}{c} \cos{\theta_{ret}} \right) {{{t}_{ret}}}
\end{equation}

With the light being received at the origin of the \hyperlink{def-Primed-Frame}{primed frame} axis at time ${t{'}} = 0$.

The coordinate transform here for retarded coordinates is the normal coordinate transform, except the time transform simplifies and allows us to take the retarded time out of brackets with just the factor $\text{\AA}={\gamma} \left(1-\frac{v}{c} \cos{\alpha} \right) = {\gamma} \left(1 + \frac{v}{c} \cos{\theta_{ret}} \right)$ now in front of it.
This factor will also come up in the Doppler effect, in aberration and when finding the density of light from a source that is emitting it continuously in all directions.
We can use this factor to simplify equations like we did with $\gamma$ previously.
We will call $\text{\AA}$ the aberrational factor, but it is also referred to as the relativistic Doppler factor.

When swapping to the primed frame, the angle that the light is being emitted and the angle it is being received at has changed, this is called the relativistic aberration of light.
This aberration will be described fully in the next chapter.

\textbf{Side Note:}

This retarded position of the source is at its retarded time.
If you wanted to find the position of where the source is at the same time as the observer, $t'=0$, we need to propagate this from its retarded position and time, to this time of zero.
So we need to take into account that the source is moving at $u = -v$ and the retarded time is the negative of the time that we want to pass, for the source to move to its current position.
These negatives cancel out.
This gives the current position, with a bit of working out, as

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: primed position with synced times}
	\underline{r}'_{t{'} = 0} = \underline{r}'_{ret} + \underline{v}t'_{ret} = {c}{{t}_{ret}}
	\begin{pmatrix}
		0                               \\
		\sin{\alpha}                    \\
		\frac{1}{{\gamma}} \cos{\alpha} \\
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

So for a stationary source in the rest frame at $t=0$, we have this position in the primed frame at $t'=0$.

\section{The Transformed Retarded Coordinates} \label{sect: Delayed View of Transformed Coordinates}

If we treat the coordinates of a coordinate system as retarded sources of light in the same way as we did for the source in the previous section, we can transform these retarded coordinates of the initial frame into the primed frame
This is shown in the figure below for a small subset of coordinates, to give you an idea of how the initial frame's retarded coordinates are spread in the primed frame.

The density of these initial frame's retarded coordinates in its own frame is constant everywhere, but in the primed frame, these initial frames coordinates have a density that depends on the angle, as shown in the figure below.
This figure is shown but not derived, as this requires mathematics from later in section (\ref{sect: Angular Density of Light from a Point Source}).

\section{Perceived Velocity} \label{sect: Perceived Velocity}

From the previous section we have seen that objects are perceived to be at their retarded positions, That would also mean that we also have that the rate of change of the perceived positions being different to their actual rate of change.
That is, the perceived velocity of an object is different from its actual velocity.
This was demonstrated in section (\ref{subsect: Perceived vs Actual Speed}), where we have seen that objects can be perceived to be going faster than light even if they are not actually doing so.
Here we will show how to find the perceived velocity of objects.

If we have a moving particle positioned at $\underline{r}$, then in a infinitesimal time ${dt}$ it will move

\begin{equation}
	d\underline{r}= \underline{u} {dt}
\end{equation}

to position $\underline{r} + d\underline{r}$, as shown in the diagram

Leading to a different retarded time between the positions than the actual time between them. As to due to the particle moving to a different position, the light may also have to travel a different distance, which also introduces an additional time difference. This gives a different perceived velocity to the actual velocity.}
	\label{fig: Perceived velocity}
\end{figure}
%███████████

The difference between the retarded times of light from each position reaching the origin, is the time that light takes to get from position  $\underline{r} + d\underline{r}$ minus the time it takes to get from position $\underline{r}$, plus the time it takes for the particle to move to the new position $dt$. Which is


\begin{equation}
	dt_{ret} =   \frac{\|\underline{r} + d\underline{r}\|}{c} -  \frac{\|\underline{r}\|}{c} + dt
\end{equation}

since $d\underline{r}$ is infinitesmally small we can simplify this expression by using some approximations as shown in the following

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\|\underline{r} + d\underline{r}\| & \color{gray} =  \sqrt{(\underline{r} + d\underline{r}) \cdot (\underline{r} + d\underline{r})}                                       \\
		                                   & \color{gray} = \sqrt{\underline{r} \cdot \underline{r} + 2 \underline{r} \cdot d\underline{r} + d\underline{r} \cdot d\underline{r}} \\
		                                   & \color{gray} \approx \sqrt{\underline{r} \cdot \underline{r} + 2 \underline{r} \cdot d\underline{r}}                                 \\
		                                   & \color{gray} \approx \|\underline{r}\| \sqrt{ 1 + \frac{2 \underline{r} \cdot d\underline{r}}{\underline{r} \cdot \underline{r}}}    \\
		                                   & \color{gray} \text{using the Taylor expansion $\sqrt{1 + x} \approx 1 + \frac{x}{2} \text{ for } x \ll 1$:}                          \\
		                                   & \color{gray} \approx \|\underline{r}\| \left(1 + \frac{\underline{r} \cdot d\underline{r}}{\|\underline{r}\|^2 }\right)              \\
		                                   & \color{gray} \approx \|\underline{r}\|  + \frac{\underline{r} \cdot d\underline{r}}{\|\underline{r}\|}                               \\
		                                   & \approx \|\underline{r}\|  + \underline{\hat{r}} \cdot d\underline{r}
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

so for the infinitesimal change we have $\|\underline{r} + d\underline{r}\|= \|\underline{r}\|   + \underline{\hat{r}} \cdot d\underline{r}$, and we have the perceived time that has passed at the origin as

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		dt_{ret} & \color{gray} =   dt + \frac{\underline{\hat{r}} \cdot d\underline{r}}{c}     \\
		         & \color{gray} = dt + \frac{\underline{\hat{r}} \cdot \underline{u} dt}{ c}    \\
		         & = \left( 1 + \frac{ \underline{u} \cdot \underline{\hat{r}} }{ c} \right) dt
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

The distances between the points is the same to the observer as the true distance between them, it is just the perceived times that are different.
Therefore, we can get the perceived/retarded velocity as

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\underline{u}_{ret} & \color{gray}= \frac{d\underline{r}}{dt_{ret}}                                                                     \\
		                    & \color{gray}= \frac{d\underline{r}}{ \left( 1 + \frac{ \underline{u} \cdot \underline{\hat{r}} }{ c} \right) dt } \\
		                    & = \frac{\underline{u}}{ 1 + \frac{ \underline{u} \cdot \underline{\hat{r}} }{ c} }
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

This equation shows that the perceived velocity can be much smaller or larger depending on which direction the object is moving.
For something moving at the speed of light, we have $ 0.5 c \leq \|\underline{u}_{ret}\| \leq \infty $ depending on the direction it is moving.

\section{Summary}\label{sect: Summary chapter 3}

In this chapter we introduced retarded positions which are the positions an observer perceives objects to be at due to the delay in the light signal from the object to the observer, with their associated retarded time, which is the time light takes to travel from the retarded position to the observer.
We also derived how to transform these retarded coordinates to the prime frames retarded coordinates.
The retarded coordinate transform and also the density of the transformed initial frames retarded coordinates in the primed frame were shown in figure (\ref{fig: retarded coordinate transform}) and figure (\ref{fig: Density of initial frame's retarded coordinates in primed frame}) respectively.
We then derived the retarded velocity of objects, which is the velocity that an observer perceives an object to be moving at, that is consequence of the delay in the light signal.
You could go one step further and find the retarded acceleration if you wanted to, but we will leave that for now.
This differs to the actual speed the object is moving.
What we have learned here will be used later when transforming light pulses later.

\chapter{A Point Source: Emitting a Pulse of Light} \label{ch: A Point Source Emitting a Pulse of Light}

% *** from here on we will use notation specific to the rest frame, as it will be easier to follow later
% *** for rest frame, exclusively use $(\mathring{x},\mathring{y},\mathring{z}, \mathring{t})$ and just use $(x,y,z)$ for the frame that is not the rest frame

% *** also decide on $t_0$ or $\mathring{t}$

% *** $\mathring{l}$ = $(\mathring{x}_0,\mathring{y}_0,\mathring{z}_0,\mathring{t})$

If a light pulse is emitted from a point source in all directions in its rest frame, how will this be effected in a frame where the source is now moving?
This will be the topic of this chapter.
For this, we will look at the velocity transform specifically for the speed of light, which will be used throughout this chapter, then moving on to look at the effect the transform has on the frequency of light that a source emits, the "Doppler effect".
Next we will get to "relativistic aberration", which is how the angle that the emitted light is propagated at, is effected.
The combined effects of these together is called "relativistic beaming".
Knowing all this will allow us to transform a field of continuously emitted light from a source in the next chapter, and find the properties this field of light has.
But to allow us to do all this, we will first need to describe the mathematics of spherical polar coordinates.
The topics of relativistic aberration and beaming in this chapter are not topics that are touched upon in most special relativity sources, but they are interesting and hold some important insights, that you will hopefully appreciate.

\section{Spherical Polar Coordinates}\label{sec: Spherical Polar Coordinates}

Before we go any further with special relativity, we will need to take some time making sure we know the math needed for what comes next.
This section will be about spherical polar coordinates, which will help us describe how the propagation of light changes between frames, by allowing us to explain aberration, which is how the propagation angle changes between frames, and the Doppler effect, which is how the wave length of light changes between frames.
So let us start with how to describe a vector in terms of the spherical polar coordinates, which is shown in the following figure in red:

\end{figure}
%███████████

The figure shows, for a given position $\underline{r}$ we have the Cartesian coordinates $({x},{y},{z})$, but we can also write this position in terms of spherical polar coordinates $(r,\theta,\phi)$.
Where the angles from the Z-Axis and X-axis are $\theta$ (between 0 and $\pi$) and $\phi$ (between 0 and $2\pi$) respectively, and ${r}$ is the displacement to the position from the origin.

The position can be written using either coordinate system as follows

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: cartesian to spherical polar coordinates}
	\mhl{
		\underline{r} =
		\begin{pmatrix}
			x \\
			y \\
			z \\
		\end{pmatrix}
		= r
		\begin{pmatrix}
			\cos{\phi}\sin{\theta} \\
			\sin{\phi}\sin{\theta} \\
			\cos{\theta}           \\
		\end{pmatrix}
	}
\end{equation}

with

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		r = \|\underline{r}\| & =\sqrt{x^2 + y^2 + z^2}      \\
		\cos\theta            & = \frac{z}{r}                \\
		\cos\phi              & = \frac{x}{\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}}
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

This is all the spherical polar coordinates math we shall need for this chapter.
We will be needing to derive some more math beyond this in the next chapter, but we will look at this when it comes to it.

% Some useful formulae for later are the unit vectors

% \begin{equation}
% 	\underline{\hat{\text{${r}$}}} =
% 	\begin{pmatrix}
% 		\sin\theta \, \cos\phi \\
% 		\sin\theta \, \sin\phi \\
% 		\cos\theta             \\
% 	\end{pmatrix},
% 	\underline{\hat{\text{$\theta$}}} =
% 	\begin{pmatrix}
% 		\cos\theta \, \cos\phi \\
% 		\cos\theta \, \sin\phi \\
% 		-\sin\theta            \\
% 	\end{pmatrix},
% 	\underline{\hat{\text{$\phi$}}} =
% 	\begin{pmatrix}

% 		\hphantom{-} \, \cos\phi \\
% 		0                        \\
% 	\end{pmatrix}
% \end{equation}

% and the differentials with respect to each of the coordinates are

% \begin{equation}
% 	\begin{aligned}

\section{Velocity Transform of Light from a Source} \label{sect: Light Velocity Transform}

From here we will start referencing explicitly the rest frame of a source, and a frame with the source moving at a speed $u$.
We will denote the terms in the rest frame with a subscript zero (i.e. $\text{term}_0$), and the moving frame with unaltered notation, as it will be the moving frame that we will be interested in finding information about, and it will allow more easily read equations for this chapter and the next.
Think of it as the frame with the source moving being the current frame, with the rest frame being one we need to make comparisons to.
Now lets get back to it.

The speed of light remains the same after transforming between frames, but the velocity does not, as the direction it propagates changes.
Light emitted at a speed $c$ from a source at rest, at an angle $\alpha_0$ from the z-axis and $\varphi_0$ from the x-axis, has the velocity written in spherical polar coordinates as

\begin{equation}
	\underline{c_0}  = {c} \cdot {\underline{\hat{c}_0}}= {c}
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\cos{\varphi_0}\sin{\alpha_0} \\
		\sin{\varphi_0}\sin{\alpha_0} \\
		\cos{\alpha_0}                \\
	\end{pmatrix},
\end{equation}

then for the frame with the source moving at speed $u$ in the z-direction, we have this frame moving at $v=-u$ relative to the rest frame.
So using the velocity \hyperlink{def-transform}{transform} from equation \eqref{eq: velocity transform} we get this frame light's velocity as

% \begin{equation}
% \begin{aligned}
% & {u_x}{'} = \frac{c\sin\alpha_0\cos\varphi_0}{{\gamma} \bigg(1-\frac{v\cos\alpha_0}{c}\bigg) } \\ & {u_y}{'} = \frac{c\sin\alpha_0\sin\varphi_0}{{\gamma} \bigg(1-\frac{v\cos\alpha_0}{c}\bigg) } \\ & {u_z}{'} = \frac{c\cos\alpha_0- {v}}{ \bigg(1-\frac{v\cos\alpha_0}{c}\bigg) }
% \end{aligned}
% \end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: velocity transform for light}
	\mhl{
		\underline{c} = c
		\begin{pmatrix}
			\cos\varphi\sin\alpha \\
			\sin\varphi\sin\alpha \\
			\cos\alpha            \\
		\end{pmatrix}
		=
		\dfrac{c}{{\gamma}\left(1+\frac{u}{c} \cos\alpha_0\right) }
		\begin{pmatrix}
			\cos\varphi_0\sin\alpha_0                        \\
			\sin\varphi_0\sin\alpha_0                        \\
			{\gamma} \left( \cos\alpha_0+\frac{u}{c} \right) \\
		\end{pmatrix}
	}
\end{equation}

Using a bit of trigonometry to find the z-components in terms of sines instead of cosines, and substituting them into the other two components, you can find that $\varphi=\varphi_0$.

% This can also be written in Cartesian coordinates of the rest frame $\underline{r_0}=(x_0,y_0,z_0)$, as

% \begin{equation}
% 	\label{eq: velocity transform for light cartesian}
% 			\underline{c} =
% 			\dfrac{c}{{\gamma}\left(1+\frac{u}{c} \frac{z_0}{r_0}\right) }
% 			\begin{pmatrix}
% 				\frac{x_0}{r_0}                          \\
% 				\frac{y_0}{r_0}                          \\
% 				{\gamma} \left( \frac{z_0}{r_0} +\frac{u}{c} \right) \\
% 			\end{pmatrix}
% \end{equation}

This frames velocity still has the same speed of light, which can be shown by taking the magnitude of the velocity vector.
However, the angle of propagation from the z-axis has changed, the change in this angle is described from the z-components of the equation above, as

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: cosine transform}
	\cos\alpha = \dfrac{ \left( \cos\alpha_0+\frac{u}{c} \right)}{\left(1+\frac{u}{c} \cos\alpha_0\right) }
\end{equation}

This is the relativistic aberration formula \cite{einstein1905electrodynamics}, it shows how the light's propagation direction transforms, shown in Figure (\ref{fig: aberrated emitted light}).
Rearranging this equation can give us the coordinate conversion in the opposite direction

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: inverse cosine transform}
	\cos\alpha_0 = \dfrac{ \left( \cos\alpha - \frac{u}{c} \right)}{\left(1 - \frac{u}{c} \cos\alpha\right) }
\end{equation}

These equations showing how the cosine of the propagation angle of the emitted light changes, will be put to use in the next section.

\section{Aberration in Special Relativity} \label{sect: Aberration in Special Relativity}

We have just derived how the propagation angle of light changes when swapping frames.
Here we shall show visually, the differences in propagation angle, by looking at the following situation.

If a source in its rest frame emits light evenly in all directions, then each emitted light's angle of propagation is transformed using equation \eqref{eq: velocity transform for light}.
The angles of the light's propagation from the z-axis, in the source's moving frame are found using equation \eqref{eq: cosine transform}.
This is shown in the following diagram.

%█████████████

	\label{fig: aberrated emitted light}
\end{figure}
%███████████

The diagram shows that we end up having a moving source emitting more of its radiation in the direction of its movement, compared to its rest frame, this is called relativistic aberration.
If we want to see the opposite, with light instead being absorbed instead of emitted, we can look at the following figure.

%█████████████
\begin{figure}[H]
	\begin{subfigure}{.49\textwidth}
		\centering
		\includegraphics[width = 5cm]{images/pdf/Aberrated_velocities_inwards_restframe.pdf}

	\label{fig: aberrated absorbed light}
\end{figure}
%███████████

For the case of a source, as its speed tends to the speed of light, $u/c$ tends to 1, and from equation \eqref{eq: cosine transform} we can see that, as a result of this, $\cos\alpha$ tends to 1.
This means that all emitted light in a source's rest frame tends to the direction of its movement.
We also have that the flow of time for the moving source relative to the rest frame, will become infinitely slow, coming to a stop, relative to the rest frame, when moving at the speed of light.
That is, the act of emittance of the light stalls.
For both these reasons the light would remain in the vicinity of the source.
This should give you something to ponder about.

\section{Doppler Effect} \label{sect: Doppler Effect}

When we swap between frames there is also a change in light's wavelength, This is called the Doppler effect, and was shown by the color shift in the previous section's figures.
We will describe this effect using the help of the following simple figure of light being emitted from a source in its rest frame and a frame that it is moving.

The different color of light in each frame is showing the effect on the lights frequency and hence color, due to the Doppler effect.}
	\label{fig: Doppler effect}
\end{figure}
%███████████

In the rest frame of the source, if it emits a wave at the speed of light in any direction, we have the length the wave has traveled from the source in the infinitesimal time ${dt_0}$ as being

\begin{equation}
	{d\lambda_0} = {c}{dt_0}
\end{equation}

If we change to a frame where the source is moving at velocity ${\underline{u}}$ in the z-direction, we have the wave emitted at an angle $\alpha$ from the z-axis, traveling a distance ${c}{dt}$ in a time ${dt}$, with the source moving a distance $ u {dt} \cos\alpha $ in the direction of this emitted wave.
It leads to a bunching up of the wave in the direction of the movement of the source, as the same amount of the wave has been emitted in this frame's corresponding time, but the distance it has traveled from the source is

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		{d\lambda} & \color{gray}= {c}{dt}-{u} \cos\alpha {dt}   \\
		           & \color{gray}=  (1-\frac{u}{c}\cos\alpha)cdt \\
		           & = {\gamma} (1-\frac{u}{c}\cos\alpha)cdt_0   \\
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

With ${dt} = {\gamma} {dt_0}$ being used in the last step, due to time dilation, from equation {eq: time dilation}.
The ratio of displacement the wave is taking up compared to in the \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame} is

\begin{equation}
	\frac{d\lambda}{d\lambda_0} = {\gamma} \left(1-\dfrac{u}{c} \cos\alpha \right)
\end{equation}

Wavelength is inversely proportional to the frequency, and this bunching up at the front will proportionally decrease the wavelength, the frequency ratio $\nu/\nu_0$ is then

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: Doppler Effect}
	\frac{\nu}{\nu_0} = \frac{d\lambda_0}{d\lambda} = \frac{1}{ {\gamma} \left(1-\dfrac{u}{c} \cos\alpha \right)}
\end{equation}

This gives us a formula to find out how the frequency of a moving source's emitted light differs from when it is at rest.

This frequency shift can be used in astronomy to determine how fast stars and galaxies are moving relative to us on earth.
It is done by measuring the frequency of light from the star/galaxy and comparing it to the expected frequency if it was at rest, with the expected frequency calculated using some astrophysics which we won't go into here.
But for those who are interested, there are two videos explaining how we work such things out in astrophysics \href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YdOXS_9_P4U}{[part 1]}\href{https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hFMaT9oRbs4}{[part 2]}.

\section{Relativistic Beaming} \label{sect: Relativistic Beaming}

Relativistic beaming is the combination of both of the effects from the two previous sections.
To show it, we will look at a light pulse that had been emitted from a source in its rest frame, and how this looks in a frame where the source is moving.
First by applying the Lorentz transform to the pulse and source, and then propagating the pulse backwards or forwards in time to sync the lights times with the source at the origin.

The black dot shows the current location of the source, with gray dot showing its position when the pulse was emitted. All the propagation of the light is in the direction that is outward from this point.}
	\label{fig Relativistic beaming}
\end{figure}
%███████████

The pulse positions in the moving frame with the time synced with the source at the origin are shown in figure (\ref{fig: Relativistic beaming 3}).
They can be found from the Lorentz transformed rest frame coordinates shown in figure (\ref{fig: Relativistic beaming 2}) by propagating the light, from these transformed coordinates, forward or backwards in time to be synced with the origin's time of zero.
So the light's position in the moving frame at the time of zero is

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: synced time light}
	\underline{l} = \underline{r} - \underline{c} t
\end{equation}

Where $\underline{r}$ is the lights positions from the Lorentz transformed rest frame coordinates at the Lorentz transformed time $t$, with $\underline{c}$ being the velocity of light in the moving frame.

This can be extended to multiple pulses, which will be done in the next chapter to see what a field of light pulses from a moving source would look like.

\section{Retarded Propagation of Light in Source's Moving Frame} \label{subsect: Retarded Light Propagation}

There is a delay between when the light is emitted from a source and when it reaches a receiver.
Due to this, there is a difference in where you see moving objects compared to where they currently are.
If the object is moving at velocity $\underline{u}$ you see it at a previous position $\underline{u} {T}_{ret}$, called its retarded position, where it was positioned at the retarded time ${T}_{ret}$.
The time the object and the light took to propagate from this retarded position to where they currently are is the same, this time is $T_p=-{T}_{ret}$.
We can use the following figure to find the retarded position and time the light was emitted, then use this to find the velocity of the light.

To find the propagated distance of the light, we first have to derive the propagation time.
You can skip past this derivation if you would like, as it does not add much to the understanding.

%*** explain what is going to be derived and how it will be derived (pre-expose the line of thought):
%*** make it so that it makes sense whether the derivation is hidden or not
%█████████████████
\begin{derivation}

	The triangle that the three vectors make in the diagram above, allows us to get the equation for the velocity of the light as

	\begin{equation}
		\underline{c} T_p = \underline{u} T_p + \underline{l}
	\end{equation}

	with $\underline{l}=(l_{x},l_{y},l_{z})$, writing out the vectors and rearranging to get the velocity vector for the light, gives

	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq: retarded light velocity vector}
		\underline{c} = \frac{1}{ T_p}
		\begin{pmatrix}
			l_{x} \\
			l_{y} \\
			l_{z} + u T_p
		\end{pmatrix}
	\end{equation}

	The magnitude of the light's displacement is equal to the distance the light travels in the corresponding propagation time $ c T_p = \|\underline{c} T_p\|$. The square of this gives

	\begin{equation}
		\begin{aligned}
			\left( c T_p\right)^2 & = \|\underline{c} T_p\|^2                                     \\
			                      & = (l_{x}^2 + l_{y}^2 + l_{z}^2) + u^2 {T_p}^2 + 2u T_p l_{z},
			%        (c^2 - v^2) T_{p}^2 &=  (x^2 + y^2 + z^2) - 2v T_{p}z
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}

	rearranging this, we get the quadratic

	\begin{equation}
		{T_p}^{2} - \left(2\gamma^2\frac{u}{c^2} l_{z}\right)T_p - \frac{\gamma^2}{c^2}(l_{x}^2 + l_{y}^2 + l_{z}^2) = 0,
	\end{equation}

	where $\gamma = (1 - u^2/c^2)^{-1/2}$.
	Now taking the positive solution to this, which corresponds to the past time, and making use of the identity

	\begin{equation}
		\gamma^2 = 1+\gamma^2\frac{u^2}{c^2},
	\end{equation}

	we get the result

	\begin{equation}
		\begin{aligned}
			T_p & = \gamma^2\frac{u}{c^2} l_{z} + \sqrt{\left(-\gamma^2\frac{u}{c^2} l_{z} \right)^2+\frac{\gamma^2}{c^2}(l_{x}^2 + l_{y}^2+ l_{z}^2)} \\
			    & = \gamma^2\frac{u}{c^2} l_{z} + \frac{\gamma}{c}\sqrt{l_{x}^2+ l_{y}^2+\left(1+\gamma^2\frac{u^2}{c^2}\right) l_{z}^2}               \\
			    & = \gamma^2\frac{u}{c^2} l_{z} + \frac{\gamma}{c}\sqrt{l_{x}^2 + l_{y}^2+\gamma^2 l_{z}^2}
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}

	This is the time it has taken to propagate the light from where the source was when it was emitted to the current position.

\end{derivation}
%███████████████

The propagated distance of the light can then be found from the derived propagation time, as

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: propagation distance}
	\begin{aligned}
		L_{p} & \color{gray} = c T_p                                             \\
		      & \color{gray} = \gamma^2 \frac{u}{c} l_{z} + \gamma  L            \\
		      & = \gamma \left( 1 + \frac{u}{c} \frac{\gamma l_{z}}{L} \right) L
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

With $ L=\sqrt{l_{x}^2+l_{y}^2+\gamma^2 l_{z}^2}$.

Substituting this into equation \eqref{eq: retarded light velocity vector} we can find the light's velocity at $\underline{l}$ to be
%at any point $\underline{l}=(l_{x},l_{y},l_{z})$ in the field as

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: direction of light from moving source}
	\mhl{
		\underline{c} =
		\frac{c}{ \gamma \left( 1 + \frac{u}{c} \frac{\gamma l_{z}}{L} \right) }
		\begin{pmatrix}
			\frac{l_{x}}{L} \\
			\frac{l_{y}}{L} \\
			\gamma \left( \frac{\gamma l_{z}}{L} + \frac{u}{c} \right)
		\end{pmatrix}
	}
\end{equation}

If we remove the speed of light from this light's velocity, we have its unit vector, with its z-component being the cosine of the angle from the z-axis, in this frame with the source moving, giving an equation that will come in useful next chapter

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: cos alpha prime in terms of l}
	\cos{\alpha} = \frac{ \frac{\gamma l_{z}}{L} + \frac{u}{c}}{ 1 + \frac{u}{c} \frac{\gamma l_{z}}{L}}
\end{equation}

Earlier, in the derivation above, you may have noticed that we introduced the $\gamma$ term.
Even though we are not changing between frames, and are just looking at the delay in signal that light has in getting to a particular point.
We have made use of the $\gamma$ term to simplify the equations like we do in special relativity, but we are not evoking special relativity here.
I just wanted to emphasize that the $\gamma$ term has a role to play for this too, and it has to be this way to allow special relativity to be self-consistent when swapping between frames.
We will be looking at this when swapping between frames in the next section.

% One of the reasons I have separated this section from the next, is that
%We could just as easily have said that this setup system is an initial frame and used the coordinates without the symbol to represent a moving frame ($'$), but we have the choice to denote this as the moving frame, as this will help in the next chapter.

\section{Light's Propagation when Swapping from Rest Frame}\label{subsect: Emitted Light When Swapping Frame}

This section is similar to what we have just done, but here we will be swapping between frames and that is where the emphasis will be.
This section will be used in the next chapter when we have continuous pulses of light in all directions from a source and want to see how this field of light transforms and what it looks like with a moving source.

Here, we will look at the propagation of light that had been emitted from a source at rest, then swap to a frame where the source is now moving, using the Lorentz transformation of the emitted light's current locations in the rest frame (from $\underline{r_0}$ to $\underline{r}$), but remembering these Lorentz transformed times $t$ are not synchronized with the sources time of zero.
To find this we will use the moving frame's velocity of light $\underline{c}$ to propagate back the light from where it is at $t$ to where it is at the origin's time of zero.

Now to derive the lights position at time of zero in the moving frame, $\underline{l}$

%█████████████████
\begin{derivation}

	As visualized in the above in figure (\ref{fig: appendix Retarded field outward field transform}).
	If we have a source in its \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame}, that had emitted light from the origin and propagated to its current position $\underline{r_0}$ at time ${t_0} = 0$.
	Then using the coordinate transform from equation \eqref{eq: Lorentz transformation} on position $\underline{r_0}=\underline{l_0}=(l_{0x},l_{0y},l_{0z})$ with time ${t_0} = 0$, we get

	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq: displacement transform}
		\begin{aligned}
			\underline{r} & =
			\begin{pmatrix}
				l_{0x}          \\
				l_{0y}          \\
				{\gamma} l_{0z} \\
			\end{pmatrix},                                                                         \\
			\text{but, at time \ \ \ }                                                              \\
			{t}           & =-{\gamma} \frac{{v}}{{c}^2}{l_{0z}} = {\gamma} \frac{u}{{c}^2}{l_{0z}} \\
		\end{aligned}
	\end{equation}

	The light's velocity in the moving frame can be found by using the velocity transform from equation \eqref{eq: velocity transform for light} and converting the spherical polar coordinate to Cartesian using equation \eqref{eq: cartesian to spherical polar coordinates}, giving

	\begin{equation}
		\label{eq: light pulse velocity transform}
		\underline{c} =
		% = \dfrac{c}{1 + \dfrac{u}{c} \frac{z}{R} }
		% \begin{pmatrix}
		% 	\frac{1}{\gamma} \frac{x}{R} \\
		% 	\frac{1}{\gamma} \frac{y}{R} \\
		% 	\dfrac{u}{c} + \frac{z}{R}   \\
		% \end{pmatrix}
		\dfrac{c}{\gamma \left(1 + \dfrac{u}{c} \dfrac{l_{0z}}{\|\underline{l}_0\|} \right)}
		\begin{pmatrix}
			\frac{l_{0x}}{\|\underline{l}_0\|}                                      \\
			\frac{l_{0y}}{\|\underline{l}_0\|}                                      \\
			\gamma \left( \frac{l_{0z}}{\|\underline{l}_0\|} + \frac{u}{c}  \right) \\
		\end{pmatrix}
	\end{equation}

	% can also show in spherical polar coordinates
	% The time that the source emitted the light in the \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame} was ${T}_{ret} =-{T}_{p}$ which corresponds to the contracted emitted time in the primed frame
	% \begin{equation}
	% 	T'_{ret} = {\gamma} {T}_{ret} =-{\gamma} {T}_{p}
	% \end{equation}
	% In the \hyperlink{def-Primed-Frame}{primed frame}, the \hyperlink{def-retarded-position}{retarded position} that the source emits the light pulse is
	% \begin{equation}
	% 	\underline{s}'_{ret} = \underline{u} T'_{ret}
	% \end{equation}
	% To find the position the light pulse is currently at, at time ${t{'}} = 0$, we have to propagate the light from the retarded position from the retarded time ${T}_{ret}=-{T'_{p}} $ to the current time ${t{'}} = 0$.

	Now we have enough to find position $\underline{l}$ where the light is positioned when its time is synchronized with the source.
	We could use the triangle formed in figure (\ref{fig: primed frame 1}), which gives $\underline{l} = \underline{c} T_{p} -\underline{u} T_{p}$ like we did in the previous section.
	But it is easier to use the Lorentz transformed position and time, and just propagate the light back to the time of zero, which is what we did previously in equation \eqref{eq: synced time light}.

% The propagation time that the light has taken in the \hyperlink{def-proper-frame}{rest frame} was ${T}_{p}= l_0 / c$, this corresponds to the dilated time in the primed frame

% \begin{equation}
% 	T'_{p} = {\gamma} {T}_{p} = \gamma \frac{\|\underline{l}_0\|}{c}
% \end{equation}

finally we can cancel out terms and simplify to get

	}

This is the position of the light at time zero, the same as the time of the source at the origin. This equation is what we will use to transform the position's of light in the next chapter, when we look at light that is being continuously emitted from a source, as shown in figure (\ref{fig: full field transformation}).

\section{Summary}\label{sect: Summary chapter 4}

In this chapter looked at the equations for spherical polar coordinates, and with them, we wrote the transform for the velocity of light.
We used it to show that the emitted light is angled more towards the direction of a moving source relative to the direction in the sources rest frame, aberrational effect.
We also showed that the frequency is increased in the direction of motion relative to its rest frame, the Doppler effect.
Together these two effects are called relativistic beaming.
After this we looked at emitted light at time $t_0=0$ in the sources rest frame, and how to transform it to a frame where the source is moving, to a time $t=0$.
This will all come in useful in the next chapter when we look at a source that is continuously emitting light in all directions, and how this field of light transforms to a frame where the source is moving.

\chapter{A Point Source: Continuous Radial Emission of Light} \label{ch: A Point Source Continually Emitting Light} %A Point Source: Continually Emitting Light Radially Outwards

This chapter will look at a source that continuously emits evenly distributed pulses of light radially outwards, giving a source at rest a "field" of light that spreads out evenly the further it is from the source.
The amount this light is spread out on the sphere that the light pulse creates, at a distance $r$, is proportional to the inverse square of the distance, $1/r^2$.
This inverse square law is used to describe how the classical forces between two masses or charges dissipate with the distance between them.
But, this scalar density is not the only way to get an inverse square law.
In this chapter we will look at other properties of a field of continuously emitted light, and we will see that they can also give you an inverse square law.
The other ways in which we will find this inverse square law include deconstructing the light's density into a vector of the density in each of the unit vectors of the spherical polar coordinate's directions and applying the Jacobian matrix, and also separately by using the gradient operator, this will give two different ways in which to measure of the rate of change of the density in all directions.
We will also get the inverse square law by using the Jacobian matrix on the velocity vector of light at each point in the light field, which will give us a measure of the rate of change of the velocity of light in all directions.
For each of these we will also find the corresponding quantities for the case of a moving source, with the help of the previous chapter.

But first let us look at this source at rest that is continuously emitting evenly distributed light, it gives the "field" of light shown in the first diagram in figure (\ref{fig: full field transformation}), with the second diagram in the figure showing how this "field" of light would look like in a frame with the source now moving.
Equation \eqref{eq: time synced transform} was used to transform each part of the propagating light to where it is at time $t=0$ (the time that it is synchronized with the source at the origin).
The third diagram of the figure shows the rings of each pulse, for a moving source.
The Doppler effect in each direction can be seen from how compact the rings are in each direction, with the aberrational effect being shown on each particular ring with how the light is spread out on that ring.
This combination of the relativistic Doppler and aberration effects together, is called relativistic beaming.

Now that we have the means to transform this "field" of light, we can look at some of its physical/mathematical properties, looking at each property in its rest frame and then finding out how it extends to a frame in which it is moving.
But first we will look at how to describe an infinitesimal element on the surface of each spherical pulse.
With this we will see how the density of the light on each pulse's surface changes when we look at a moving source, along with the Doppler effects on the density of light in the radial direction.

\section{Surface Element on a Sphere and its Solid Angle} \label{subsect: Surface Element on a Sphere}

We will again return to some spherical polar coordinates, but this time we will look at the differential elements, which will be used to describe an infinitesimal surface area on a sphere, and in turn find out what a solid angle is and how to derive it.
We can then find the density of light within this solid angle element, then using what we have learned previously about the aberration of light, we can find how this density of light changes for the case of a moving source.

So if we define a sphere with radius $r$ we can find an infinitesimal portion of the surface of the sphere at angles ${\theta}$ and ${\phi}$ as shown on this figure:

The surface element of a sphere at a constant radius ${r}$, spanning from $\theta$ to $\theta + d\theta$ and $\phi$ to $\phi + d\phi$, is equivalent to a rectangle with sides ${r}{dr}$ and ${r}\sin\theta {d\phi}$ giving the surface area as

\begin{equation}
	\mathrm{d}S =  r^2 \sin\theta \,\mathrm{d}\theta \,\mathrm{d}\phi
	%\left\|\frac{\partial {\underline R}}{\partial \theta} \times \frac{\partial {\underline R}}{\partial \phi}\right\| \mathrm{d}\theta \,\mathrm{d}\phi = \left\| r \underline{\underline{\hat{\text{$\theta$}}}} \times r \sin \theta \underline{\underline{\hat{\text{$\phi$}}}} \right\|
\end{equation}

This surface element's size depends on the angle from the z-axis and the distance from the origin, but if we want a quantity that only depends on the angle, we can divide the surface element by $r^2$, this gives what is called the solid angle.
The solid angle element $d\Omega$ is a measure of the amount of the field of view, from the origin, that the surface element covers. For the differential surface element shown in the figure we have the differential solid angle

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: solid angle}
	\mathrm{d}\Omega = \frac{\mathrm{d}S}{r^2} = \sin\theta \,\mathrm{d}\theta \,\mathrm{d}\phi
\end{equation}

If we were to integrate this over the whole sphere $ \int_{0}^{2\pi} \int_{0}^{\pi} \, \sin \phi \, d\theta \, d\phi$, we would get $4\pi$, which is when the view from the origin is fully covered by the surface.
Therefore, the fraction of the view from the origin that is covered by a solid angle $\Omega$ is $\Omega/ 4\pi$.

%\subsection{Flux of light Through Surface Element}\label{subsect: Flux Through Surface Element}
%... radial \hyperlink{def-flux}{flux} through surface element (search radial \hyperlink{def-flux}{flux})

Here we shall derive the light's density in an infinitesimal surface area perpendicular to the light's propagation, for a moving source.
We will do this by first finding the density of light in the solid angle element for a moving source relative to the corresponding solid angle in the rest frame, then multiply by the dissipation factor to get the density for the surface element.
With the factor being the inverse square of the propagated distance of the light from where it was emitted.

%███████████
\begin{derivation}

	If we have a source at rest emitting light in all directions we can say at certain angles given by the spherical polar coordinates $\theta = \alpha_0$ and $\phi= \varphi_0$ we have a quantity $dQ$ of the emitted light's wavefront that is encompassed in the infinitesimal solid angle

	\begin{equation}
		d\Omega_0 = \sin{\alpha_0} d\alpha_0 d\varphi_0,
	\end{equation}

	this is the same amount of the light's wavefront that is encompassed by the coinciding solid angle in the moving frame

	\begin{equation}
		d\Omega = \sin{\alpha} d\alpha d\varphi.
	\end{equation}

	We can calculate this element by differentiating both sides of equation
	\eqref{eq: cosine transform} with respect to $\alpha_0$ \cite{hogg1997special}, which after doing so, gives

	\begin{equation}
		\sin{\alpha} d\alpha = \dfrac{1}{{\gamma}^2\left(1 + \dfrac{u}{c}\cos{\alpha_0}\right)^2} \sin{\alpha_0} d\alpha_0
	\end{equation}

	now using this and ${d\varphi} = {d\varphi_0}$ (as the angle ${\varphi_0}$ is always perpendicular to the motion of the particle and unaffected by the \hyperlink{def-transform}{transformation}) we have the solid angle in the moving frame given as

	\begin{equation}
		d\Omega = \dfrac{1}{{\gamma}^2\left(1 + \dfrac{u}{c}\cos{\alpha_0}\right)^2} \sin{\alpha_0} d\alpha_0 d\varphi_0.
	\end{equation}

	%The overall amount of wavefront is conserved, as can be seen when integrating over the corresponding solid angle in either frame, both of which give the same value of $4\pi$.
	% proportional to the amount of the wavefront in the given proper differential element of the solid angle, and

	If there is the same quantity of light $dQ$ in the solid angle element in both frames, then the density of light in the solid angle in each frame is $dQ/d\Omega_0$ and $dQ/d\Omega$ respectively, giving the ratio of the density in the solid angle element in the moving frame relative to the rest frame as

	\begin{equation}
		D_{\sigma} = \frac{d\Omega_0}{d\Omega} = {\gamma}^2\left(1 + \dfrac{u}{c}\cos{\alpha_0}\right)^2.
	\end{equation}

	By substituting equation \eqref{eq: cos alpha prime in terms of l} into equation \eqref{eq: inverse cosine transform} we get $\cos\alpha_0=\frac{\gamma l_{z}}{L}$, it allows us to get this in terms of the light's position in its moving frame

	\begin{equation}
		D_{\sigma} = {\gamma}^2\left(1 + \dfrac{u}{c}\frac{\gamma l_{z}}{L}\right)^2.
	\end{equation}

	with $L = \sqrt{l^2_{x} + l^2_{y} + \gamma^2 l^2_{z}}$.

	$D_{\sigma}$ is the density of light in a solid angle element for a moving source relative to the density of light in the corresponding solid angle element in the rest frame of the source.

\end{derivation}
%███████████

At position $(l_{x},l_{y},l_{z})$, light has propagated a distance $L_p$ from where it was emitted, given in equation \eqref{eq: propagation distance},
Its surface area element grows by a factor of the $L_p^2$ and the light's density in a surface elements area dissipates by the inverse of this

\begin{equation}
	\frac{1}{L_p^2} = \frac{1}{\gamma^2 \left( 1 + \frac{u}{c} \frac{\gamma l_z}{L} \right)^2 L^2}
\end{equation}

Multiplying this by the density of light in the solid angle element relative the rest source, $D_{\sigma}/L_p^2$, we get the density of light in the surface element given as

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: denisty of light in surface element}
	\mhl{
		\begin{aligned}
			D_{\sigma} = \frac{k_{\sigma}}{L^2} \\
			\color{gray} \text{with } L & \color{gray}= \sqrt{l^2_{x} + l^2_{y} + \gamma^2 l^2_{z}}
		\end{aligned}
	}
\end{equation}

Where $k_{\sigma}$ is the proportionality constant.

For a source at rest $u=0$ we have $\gamma = 1$ and this then just gives the inverse square of the distance from the rest source, the inverse square law of the distance from the source

\begin{equation}
	D_{\sigma} = \frac{k_{\sigma}}{\sqrt{l^2_{x} + l^2_{y} + l^2_{z}}}
\end{equation}

This is what we will get when setting $u=0$ for all the properties of the light field that we will look at in each section.

$\frac{1}{L^2}$ will show up several times for a moving source in this chapter, and is plotted for a moving source and a source at rest, below.

%Later we will be looking at a moving source in a frame with coordinates denoted $(x,y,z)$, this is the primed frame of the source, but we will not be using the primed notation for the coordinates, as it is the same initial frame to us.

%  We can also write the equation in terms of the angle of the light from the z-axis in the moving frame, by substituting in equation \eqref{eq: inverse cosine transform}, which gives

\section{Density in direction of propagation of light}\label{sect: Density in direction of propagation of light}

% In the previous chapter about a single spherical pulse from a source, the outward pulse of light creates a surface of a sphere, growing bigger as it propagates outwards, with the surface area of the sphere of light equal to $4 \pi r^2$.
% There is always the same quantity of light in this increasing pulse's sphere, and we have the area of this sphere's surface increasing relative to the square of its radius.
% This gives the density of light on the surface area of this sphere being proportional to the inverse square of the radius, i.e. $1/L_p^2$.

For the case were light is being continuously emitted from a rest source, as shown in figure (\ref{subfig: full field transformation 1}), the light is emitted from the stationary source at a constant rate.
Because of this constant rate of emittance from the rest source, the light has no change in density in the direction of the light's propagation.

The Doppler effect gives the frequency of light from a moving source relative to its rest frame, in which it is constant.
The change in density of light in its propagation direction is inversely proportional to this change in this frequency,

Since this density is constant for the case of a stationary source.
Then we have this density for a moving source proportional to the Doppler effect from equation \eqref{eq: Doppler Effect}, which we can get in our current frames coordinates by substituting in equation \eqref{eq: cos alpha prime in terms of l}, giving this density for a moving source to be

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: denisty of light parallel to propagation}
	D_{c} = {\gamma}\left(1 + \dfrac{u}{c}\frac{\gamma l_z}{L}\right) k_{c}
\end{equation}

Where $k_{c}$ is the constant density of light in the direction of the light's propagation for a stationary source.

\section{Coordinates used}\label{sect: Coordinates used}

Previously we had used separate notation specifically for the rest frame of a source.
In this chapter we will remain in the same frame, and looking at a source moving at speed $u$.
The speed will be set to zero, $u=0$, to look at the case of a source at rest.
But we will remain in the same frame, its just that the sources velocity is different.
We will therefore use the same notation for coordinates throughout this chapter, $(x,y,z)$.

We will be substituting these coordinates into equations from previous sections, for the position of light in the moving frame

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: position of light}
	\underline{l} = (l_{x},l_{y},l_{z}) = (x,y,z)
\end{equation}

I hope this will not lead to confusion, since we had previously used separate notation specifically for the rest frame of a source.

% It might help to think of this frame to be the moving frame of the stationary source, but just with a speed of $u=0$.

% Setting $u=0$ in any equation in this or the previous chapter will simplify the equation to the form that describes a stationary source.

\section{Volume Density of Light}\label{sect: Field Scalar Density}

% In the previous chapter about a single spherical pulse from a source, the outward pulse of light creates a surface of a sphere, growing bigger as it propagates outwards, with the surface area of the sphere of light equal to $4 \pi r^2$.
% There is always the same quantity of light in this increasing pulse's sphere, and we have the area of this sphere's surface increasing relative to the square of its radius.
% This gives the density of light on the surface area of this sphere being proportional to the inverse square of the radius, i.e. $1/L_p^2$.

% For the case were light is being continuously emitted from a rest source, as shown in figure (\ref{subfig: full field transformation 1}), the light is spherically symmetric and is emitted from the stationary source at a constant rate, and therefore has no change in density in the direction that is radially outwards, and only has a density difference perpendicular to the direction of the light's propagation.
% This gives the total scalar density $D$ of light at any point as being proportional to the inverse square of the radius

% \begin{equation}
% 	\label{eq: scalar density}
% 	D = \frac{k}{r^2}
% \end{equation}

% Where k is the proportionality constant.
% This density of light is shown in figure (\ref{subfig_1: Density of light emitted from a source}).

Here we will see what the volume density of light is for a moving source.
We have the density of light in the direction of its propagation $D_{c}$ and in the plane perpendicular to it $D_{\sigma}$, given in equations \eqref{eq: denisty of light in surface element} and \eqref{eq: denisty of light parallel to propagation}.

Giving the volume density to be

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		D & \color{gray} = D_{\sigma} D_{c}  \\
		  & = {\gamma}\left(1 + \dfrac{u}{c}\dfrac{\gamma z}{L}\right) \frac{k_{\sigma} k_{c}}{L^2}
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

This density of light for a moving source at any point can be seen in the following diagram, with the left figure showing the volume density of light emitted from a source at rest, when $u=0$, showing the inverse square law.

\section{Light Density Deconstructed into Vector}\label{sect: Field Vector Density}

Here we will try something a little different to see if there is anything interesting to get out of it. The quantity that we are about to describe, is not something that is used in physics.

Instead of the volume density we previously had, we could describe the density of light in three perpendicular directions, with a density in the direction of the light's propagation $D_c$ given in equation \eqref{eq: denisty of light parallel to propagation}, and by deconstructing the surface element's density $D_\sigma$, from equation \eqref{eq: denisty of light in surface element} equally ($\sqrt{D_\sigma}$) into the two directions $\hat{\alpha}$ and $\hat{\phi}$, which are perpendicular to the direction of light's propagation $\hat{c}$.

The radial density is constant, and for the density in each of the angular directions we will split the inverse square law equally between them, by taking the square root of it.

% instead of
% \begin{equation}
% 	\nabla = \frac{\partial}{\partial r} \underline{e}_r + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial}{\partial\theta} \underline{e}_\theta + \frac{1}{r \sin{\theta}} \frac{\partial}{\partial\phi} \underline{e}_\phi
% \end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: density vector}
	\mhl{
	\begin{aligned}
		\underline{D} & \color{gray} = D_{c} \hat{\underline{c}} + \sqrt{D_{\sigma}}  \hat{\underline{\alpha}} + \sqrt{D_{\sigma}} \hat{\underline{\varphi}} \\
		              & = {\gamma}\left(1 + \dfrac{u}{c}\frac{\gamma z}{L}\right) k_c \hat{\underline{c}} + \frac{k_\sigma}{L} \hat{\underline{\alpha}} + \frac{k_\sigma}{L} \hat{\underline{\varphi}}
	\end{aligned}
	}
\end{equation}

*** note that $k_\sigma \rightarrow k_\sigma^2$

The components of this density vector are the densities of light in the corresponding unit vector directions

Now we will check two ways in which we can get an inverse square law from this density vector.

First, from calculating the norm of a Jacobian matrix of this density vector (a matrix of partial derivatives), it will be a measure of the rate of change of these vector density elements of light in all direction.
These density vector elements are in the directions parallel and perpendicular to the light's propagation, and we are looking at the rate of change of these with respect to x, y and z-directions.

The second way in which we will get the inverse square law, will be, by taking the magnitude of the density vector and then calculating its directional derivative $ \nabla  \| \underline{D} \| \cdot \hat{\underline{c}}$.
It is a measure of the rate of change of the magnitude of the light's density vector in the direction of the light's propagation.

\section{Jacobian Matrix of Density Vector}\label{sect: Jacobian matrix of the Density vec}

We will now check the Jacobian matrix of the density vector.
The Jacobian for our density vector is a matrix of partial derivatives of each of the density vector's components with respect to each coordinate, i.e. the rate of change of each component with respect to each coordinate, given as

\begin{equation}
	J = \begin{bmatrix}
		\frac{\partial D_{1}}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial D_{1}}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial D_{1}}{\partial z} \\
		\frac{\partial D_{2}}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial D_{2}}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial D_{2}}{\partial z} \\
		\frac{\partial D_{3}}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial D_{3}}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial D_{3}}{\partial z}
	\end{bmatrix}
\end{equation}

% \begin{equation}
% 	J = \begin{bmatrix}
% 		\frac{\partial D_{1}}{\partial r} & \frac{\partial D_{1}}{\partial \alpha_0} & \frac{\partial D_{1}}{\partial \varphi_0} \\
% 		\frac{\partial D_{2}}{\partial r} & \frac{\partial D_{2}}{\partial \alpha_0} & \frac{\partial D_{2}}{\partial \varphi_0} \\
% 		\frac{\partial D_{3}}{\partial r} & \frac{\partial D_{3}}{\partial \alpha_0} & \frac{\partial D_{3}}{\partial \varphi_0}
% 		\end{bmatrix}
% 		= \begin{bmatrix}
% 			0 & 0 & 0 \\
% 			- \frac{k_\theta}{r^2} & 0 & 0 \\
% 			- \frac{k_\phi}{r^2} & 0 & 0
% 			\end{bmatrix}
% \end{equation}

% or

% \begin{equation}
% 	J = - \frac{k_{\Omega}}{r^3}
% 	\begin{bmatrix}
% 		0 & 0 & 0 \\
% 		x & y & z \\

% 		x & y & z
% 	\end{bmatrix}
% \end{equation}


% We can then find the norm of the Jacobian matrix to be


% \begin{equation}
% 	\begin{aligned}
% 		\| J \| & \color{gray} =   \frac{k_\sigma}{r^3}\sqrt{2x^2+2y^2+2z^2} \\
% 		        & =  \frac{ \sqrt{2} k_\sigma}{r^2}
% 	\end{aligned}
% \end{equation}


% This is again found to be an inverse square law, with the proportionality constant being $\sqrt{2}k_\sigma$.
% It is a measure of the total rate of change of light's density in space.
% Now let us see this for a moving source

% %█████████████
% \subsubsection{For a Moving Source:}\label{subsubsect: General Equations for Moving Source 2}

% \begin{equation}
% 	\begin{aligned}
% 		\sqrt{\frac{D_{\sigma}}{L_p^2}} & \color{gray} =  {\gamma}\left(1 + \dfrac{u}{c}\frac{\gamma z}{L}\right) \cdot \frac{1}{\gamma \left( 1 + \frac{u}{c} \frac{\gamma z}{L} \right) L} \\
% 		                              & = \frac{1}{L}
% 	\end{aligned}
% \end{equation}


Using the density vector from equation \eqref{eq: density vector}, remembering that $ L=\sqrt{x^2+y^2+\gamma^2 z^2}$ and setting $\beta = - u/c$, we can find the Jacobian matrix of the density vector.

if it happens to be that $k_c\approx 0$, then we would get

We could also find the rate of change of the magnitude of the density vector in the direction of the light's propagation, given by the directional derivative, which is

\begin{equation}
	\nabla_c \| \underline{D} \| = \nabla \| \underline{D} \| \cdot \hat{\underline{c}}

% \subsubsection{General Equations for Moving Source}\label{subsubsect: General Equations for Moving Source 3}

Like we did for the previous section we will take $k_c \approx 0$, as the equations get very complex otherwise.
It is also required for us to get the inverse square law to hold for the rest source.

\begin{derivation}

	using $k_c \approx 0$ simplifies the density vector magnitude to

	\begin{equation}
		\| \underline{D} \| = \frac{k_\sigma}{L}
	\end{equation}

	giving the gradient of this as

	\begin{equation}
		\nabla \| \underline{D} \| = -\frac{k_\sigma}{L^3}
		\begin{pmatrix}
			x \\
			y \\
			\gamma^2 z
		\end{pmatrix}
	\end{equation}

	now taking the dot product with the direction of the light's propagation, in the case of a moving source we use the unit vector of equation \eqref{eq: light pulse velocity transform}, giving

	\begin{equation}
		\begin{aligned}
		\nabla \| \underline{D} \| \cdot \underline{\hat{c}}
		& = -\frac{k_\sigma}{L^3}
		\begin{pmatrix}
			x \\

			\gamma^2 z

		& = -\frac{2k_\sigma}{\gamma\left(1-\beta\frac{\gamma z}{L}\right)L^4} \left( x^2 + y^2 + \gamma^4 z^2 - \gamma^3 \beta z L \right)

So we have derived the directional derivative, it is complex looking, but this can be seen to achieve the inverse square law for the case of a rest source $u=0$ (giving $\beta=0$,$\gamma=1$).
But with a negative sign in front of it compared to the previous cases.
The values of the directional derivative are shown for a rest and moving source in the following figure.

%███████████

For the case of the moving source, we can see that it has both negative and positive values, showing the rate of change of the density in the direction of the light's propagation can change sign depending on position, which is not the case for the rest source which is consistently negative.

If you wanted to know what the directional derivative for the case of a rest source with none zero $k_c$ would be, then it would be given by the following equation which we wont derive here.

\begin{equation}
	\nabla_c \| \underline{D} \| = - \frac{2 k_\sigma^2}{r^2\sqrt{r^2 k_c^2 + k_\sigma^2}}
\end{equation}

The directional derivative has an extra term with $k_c$ in the denominator compared to the inverse square law.

\textbf{Side Note:}

Another side note is that it also happens to be that the magnitude of the gradient $\Big\| \nabla \| \underline{D} \| \Big\|$, gives the inverse square law, but it gives a different outcome for a moving source, compared to the directional derivative.
I just wanted to show the outcome of this, but I will not actually go into the math.
It is shown in the following figure.

these diagrams show magnitude of the rate of change of the lights propagation direction with respect to each coordinate.

the velocity vector gradient matrix of lights velocity is

\begin{equation}
	\underline{J} =
	\begin{pmatrix}
		\frac{\partial c_1}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial c_1}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial c_1}{\partial z} \\
		\frac{\partial c_2}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial c_2}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial c_2}{\partial z}
		\\
		\frac{\partial c_3}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial c_3}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial c_3}{\partial z}
	\end{pmatrix}
	= \frac{1}{ r^3 }
	\begin{pmatrix}
		y^2 + z^2 & -xy       & -xz       \\
		-xy       & x^2 + z^2 & -yz       \\
		-xz       & -yz       & x^2 + y^2
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

the norm of this ends up giving

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\|\underline{J}\| & = \color{gray} \frac{1}{r^3} \sqrt{2(x^4 + y^4 + z^4) + 4 (x^2y^2 + x^2z^2 + y^2z^2)} \\
		                  & \color{gray} = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{r^3} \sqrt{(x^2 + y^2 + z^2)^2}                        \\
		                  & = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{ r }
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

*** what about taking directional derivative of this magnitude instead which is equal to

\begin{equation}
	\nabla \| \underline{J} \| \cdot \hat{r}
\end{equation}

*** for rest source we end up getting $\Big\| \nabla \| \underline{D} \| \Big\| = \nabla \| \underline{D} \| \cdot \hat{r}$, as light is in same direction at the gradient vector

The square of the Jacobian would then be proportional to $1/r^2$ (this may seem like a bit of a cheat to get the inverse square law)

\begin{equation}
	\|\underline{J}\|^2 = \frac{2}{r^2}
\end{equation}

or you could take the gradient of the norm of the Jacobian and then take the norm of that to also get a value proportional to $1/r^2$

\begin{equation}
	\big\| \nabla \|\underline{J}\| \big\| = \frac{\sqrt{2}}{r^2}
\end{equation}

*** also try direction derivative of the Jacobian norm $ \nabla \|\underline{J}\| \cdot \hat{\underline{c}}$

None of this is meant to be taken too seriously, I am just trying to find to get an $1/r^2$ relationship using as many different meathods as I can, in the hope something will be of use down the line.

So lets look at this for a moving source.

\subsubsection{For a Moving Source:}\label{subsubsect: General Equations for Moving Source 4}

*** check with coordinates replaced with none prime coordinates

Now if we have light continuously being emitted evenly in all directions from a moving point source that is currently at the origin, as shown in figure (\ref{fig: full field transformation}) with the lights velocity described at each position $\underline{l}=(x,y,z)$ by the equation \eqref{eq: direction of light from moving source}

If we want to find the rate of change of the direction of the light's propagation $\underline{\hat{c}}$, at a point $\underline{l}$ with respect to each coordinate we can take the partial differentiates of the unit vector for the lights propagation from equation \eqref{eq: direction of light from moving source} (which is the same, just without the magnitude $c$).
This give the rate of change of the lights propagation with respect to each coordinate as:

% we can check do see if we take the dot product of the lights velocity with the rate of change that we get a value of zero, as the two vectors should be perpendicular, which we do:

% \begin{equation}
% 	\underline{\hat{c}}' \cdot \frac{\partial \underline{\hat{c}}'}{\partial x'} = l_x' (1 - \frac{l_x'^2}{ L^2} + \frac{u}{c}\frac{\gamma l_z'}{L}) + l_y' (- \frac{l_x'}{L} \frac{l_y'}{L}) + (\gamma^2 l_z' + \gamma \frac{u}{c}  L)(- \frac{l_x'}{L} \frac{l_z'}{L})=0
% \end{equation}

% \begin{equation}
% 	\underline{\hat{c}}' \cdot \frac{\partial \underline{\hat{c}}'}{\partial z'} = l_x' (( - \frac{u}{c}  - \frac{ \gamma l_z' }{L} ) \frac{l_x'}{L}) + l_y' (( - \frac{u}{c}  - \frac{\gamma l_z' }{L} ) \frac{l_y'}{L}) + (\gamma^2 l_z' + \gamma \frac{u}{c}  L)(\frac{1}{\gamma}\frac{ l_x'^2 + l_y'^2 }{ L^2})=0
% \end{equation}

The Magnitude of this Jacobian is messy so I will not write it out here, as it would serve no purpose.
Also unsure wether to include the time derivate into the Jacobian to make it a 4 by 4 tensor like below, using the velocity $( 0 , c_x , c_y , c_z )$ (with the zero representing the derivatives of time), giving

\begin{equation}
	J =
	\begin{pmatrix}
		0                                 & 0                               & 0                               & 0                               \\
		\frac{\partial c_x}{c \partial t} & \frac{\partial c_x}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial c_x}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial c_x}{\partial z} \\
		\frac{\partial c_y}{c \partial t} & \frac{\partial c_y}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial c_y}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial c_y}{\partial z} \\
		\frac{\partial c_z}{c \partial t} & \frac{\partial c_z}{\partial x} & \frac{\partial c_z}{\partial y} & \frac{\partial c_z}{\partial z} \\
	\end{pmatrix}
\end{equation}

But instead of going through this, I will end the madness of this chapter here and move on to looking at quantities that do not change when swaping frames, which will lead to the famous energy-mass and energy-momentum equations.


I have however exhausted the different ways that I thought were reasonable avenues to check. apart from a property called the material derivative, given as

\begin{equation}
	\rho {\frac {\mathrm {D} \underline {u} }{\mathrm {D} t}}=\rho \left({\frac {\partial \underline {u} }{\partial t}}+(\underline {u} \cdot \nabla )\underline {u} \right)
\end{equation}

which when the normal is taken you get $1/r$, but I shall not got through this here as its a bit too much.


% gradient being $( \delta_t , \delta_x , \delta_y , \delta_z )$



%for norm should above have negative time parts? or make complex?

\section{Summary}

In this chapter we looked at different ways/ properties and quantities that for a source at rest are proportional to $1/r^2$, i.e they follow the inverse square law.
We identified the following Quantities:

\begin{itemize}
	\item volume density $D=\frac{k}{r^2}$
	\item from vector density $k_c \hat{r} + \frac{k_\theta}{r} \hat{\theta} + \frac{k_\phi}{r} \hat{\phi}$ we have:
	\item $\| \nabla \underline{D} \| = \frac{k_{a}}{r^2}$.
	\item $\Big\| \nabla \| \underline{D} \| \Big\| = \frac{k_{a}}{r^2}$
	\item Jacobian for velocity of light $\|\underline{J}\|^2 = \frac{2}{r^2}$
\end{itemize}

For a moving source, there is rate of changes with respect to time, which are not taken into account.

take a look at the d'Alembert operator:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\square &= \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - \nabla^2 \\
		& = \frac{1}{c^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial t^2} - \left( \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2} \right) \\
		& = \beta^2 \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2} - \left( \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2} \right) \\
		& =  - \left( \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + (1-\beta^2) \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2} \right) \\
		& =  - \left( \frac{\partial^2}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2}{\partial y^2} + \frac{1}{\gamma^2} \frac{\partial^2}{\partial z^2} \right)
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

it gives

\begin{equation}
	\square \frac{1}{L} = 0
\end{equation}

is this an invariant quantity?

\chapter{Invariant Quantities} \label{ch: Invariant Quantities}

*** start here so its a bit rephreshing

Quantities that are frame-independent (quantities that do not change when we transform between inertial reference frames) are called \hyperlink{def-lorentz-invariant}{Lorentz invariant}.

In this chapter, we will see the invariant quantity related to the space-time coordinates ($x,y,z,t$) and use this to find invariant properties associated with velocities, which will lead to the more abstract conservation relation between momentum, energy and mass.
We will find a new quantity with the units of energy that has a term which approximates to the kinetic energy of a particle at low velocities and another term that suggests particles another type of energy, that was not previously in classical physics, that depends on the mass of a particle (mass-energy equivalence), this will all lead to a new conservation law of energy.
The reason we care about the concept of energy is that it has this conservation relation that we will learn about, that can be used as a tool to help us make calculations and model more complex systems.

\section{The Space-Time Interval} \label{sect: Space-Time Interval}

We define a quantity called the space-time interval $\Delta S$ between two \hyperlink{def-event}{event}s in a generic inertial reference frame as:

\begin{equation}
	\mhl{
	\Delta S^2 = (c\Delta t)^2-{\Delta x}^2-{\Delta y}^2-{\Delta z}^2
	}
	\label{eq: space-time interval}
\end{equation}

All inertial frames of reference agree on this interval as it is invariant between frames, $\Delta S = \Delta S{'}$, which can be shown when we sub the coordinate transforms from equation \eqref{eq: interval of Coordinates} into the primed version of this last equation

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\Delta S{'}^2 & = (c{\Delta t{'}})^2-\Delta x{'}^2-{\Delta y{'}}^2-{\Delta z{'}}^2                                                                                          \\
		              & \color{gray} = {c}^2{\gamma} \bigg( \Delta t-\frac{v}{{c}^2} {\Delta z} \bigg)^2-{\Delta x}^2-{\Delta y}^2-\Delta ({\gamma} ( {\Delta z}- {v} \Delta t) )^2 \\
		              & \color{gray} = (c\Delta t)^2-{\Delta x}^2-{\Delta y}^2-{\Delta z}^2                                                                                         \\
		              & = \Delta S^2.
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

This relationship will come in useful for our next section.

\section{Energy-Mass and Momentum Relation} \label{sect: Energy-Mass and Momentum Relation}

From here forward we will be making some jumps in logic and assertions, leading to claims of what we will call the total energy and rest mass energy, but I will try to give as much reasoning as I can for these choices in assertions.

We can see from the previous section that if a particle $p$, is moving in an inertial reference frame, we can define the space-time interval of its coordinates in this frame as

\begin{equation}
	\Delta S_p^2 = (c\Delta {t}_p)^2-\Delta x_p^2-{\Delta y_p}^2-{\Delta z_p}^2
\end{equation}

We will not used primed notation here ($'$), as we will not be changing between reference frames, so we will define this as our initial frame.

So now, if we divide by the square of the proper time that passes for the particle in this interval ${\Delta\tau}$ (the interval in time that passes in the particles rest frame), so that now taking the limit as the change in proper time in the interval goes to zero, we get a derivative that is an abstract invariant quantity that we will call the space-time velocity, which reduces to the following:

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\left(\frac{dS_p}{d\tau}\right)^2 & = \left(c\frac{{{dt}_{p}}}{d\tau}\right)^2-\left(c\frac{dx_p}{d\tau}\right)^2-\left(\frac{dy_p}{d\tau}\right)^2-\left(\frac{dz_p}{d\tau}\right)^2 \\
		                                  & = {c}^2\gamma^2 \left( 1-\frac{{{u}_{px}}^2 + {{u}_{py}}^2 + {{u}_{pz}}^2}{{c}^2} \right)                                                         \\
		                                  & = {c}^2\gamma^2 \left( 1-\frac{u_p^2}{{c}^2} \right)                                                                                              \\
		                                  & = {c}^2
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

It can be seen that this is still an invariant quantity as the speed of light is constant in all frames.
Now by multiplying both sides of the third line by ${m}^2{c}^2$ where $m$ is the rest mass of the particle, so we get

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: energy-momentum derivation}
	\begin{aligned}
		m^2 {c}^2 \left(\frac{dS_p}{d\tau}\right)^2 & = m^2{c}^4\gamma^2 \left( 1-\frac{u_p^2}{{c}^2} \right) \\
		({m}{c}^2)^2                                & = \gamma^2 m^2 c^4-\gamma^2 m^2 u_p^2 {c}^2
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

this is an invariant quantity with the units of energy squared, this quantity does not depend on the speed of a particle, it is an intrinsic energy that a particle of mass $m$ has, we could call this the rest mass energy of a particle:

\begin{equation}
	E_0=mc^2
\end{equation}

This could be taken as a new type of energy all masses have even when at rest, so say a particle at rest was to decay into photons, we would have the photons emitted from it, be equal to this energy.
I agree this does not seem like a very proper way to get this equation, or atleast looks like that we have took a shortcut, but we will look at what the other terms represent, to see if we get anything else that may convince us a little more that this is an okay interpretation of this invariant quantity of energy.
So lets rearrange the previous equation, to get

\begin{equation}
	\label{eq: total relativistic energy}
	\left( \gamma m {c}^2 \right)^2 = ({m}{c}^2)^2 + \left( \gamma {m}{u_p}{c}\right)^2
\end{equation}

we can use what is called the Taylor expansion to write out $\gamma$ in an infinite series that converges to a value the more you go along it, this techniques shows that $\gamma$ is equivalent to writing it out as this

\begin{equation}
	\gamma \equiv 1 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{u^2}{{c}^2} + \frac{3}{8}\frac{u^4}{c^4} + ...
\end{equation}

now multiplying this term by $mc^2$ we have this energy term given as

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\gamma {m}{c}^2 & = {m}{c}^2  \left(1 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{u^2}{{c}^2} + \frac{3}{8}\frac{u^4}{c^4} + ...
		\right)                                                                                                 \\
		                & = {m}{c}^2 + \frac{1}{2}{m}{u}^2 + \frac{3}{8}m\frac{u^4}{{c}^2} + ...
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

This equation's first quantity is an energy that does not depend on the speed of the particle.
It is the invariant energy from before, the rest mass energy.
The second quantity is the classical kinetic energy formula, the rest may be seen as higher-order kinetic energy terms, that are not seen in classical physics because they are very small for ${u}<<{c}$, so this seems like it could be a formula for the total energy of a particle (in a vaccum, that is with no potential energy).
we will denote this total energy ${E}$, with the rest energy from before denoted as $E_0$ giving equation \eqref{eq: total relativistic energy} to be written as

\begin{equation}
	E^2 = E_0^2 + (\gamma{m}{u}{c})^2
\end{equation}

Now let us look at this second quantity along with the Taylor expansion of $\gamma$ which gives

\begin{equation}
	\begin{aligned}
		\gamma {c}{m}{u} & = {c}{m}{u} \left(1 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{u^2}{{c}^2} + \frac{3}{8}\frac{u^4}{c^4} + ...
		\right)                                                                                                   \\
		                 & ={c}\left( {m}{u} + \frac{1}{2}m \frac{u^3}{{c}^2} + \frac{3}{8}m\frac{u^5}{c^4} + ...
		\right)
	\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

which at small particle velocities is approximately $({m}{u}){c}$ with ${m}{u}$ being the classical momentum, we could assert that this whole energy $E_p$ is just momentum times speed of light, but in the relativistic context, that is we can not think of this as the relativistic momentum:

\begin{equation}
	p = \gamma {m}{u}
\end{equation}

as it has the same units and is approximately the classical momentum at small particle speeds.

If we are to believe all this then we would have the final equation relating the energy and momentum of a particle as

\begin{equation}
	\mhl{
		\begin{aligned}
			E^2 & = E_0^2 + (E_p)^2   \\
			    & = (mc^2)^2 + (pc)^2
		\end{aligned}
	}
\end{equation}

The reason we believe all this to be the correct interpretation of these equations is because they agree with experiments, so despite the strange way of getting to them, they seem to be correct, or atleast extremely good approximations.

%*** Momentum in special relativity is defined slightly differently, to ensure that the law of conservation of momentum holds true in all inertial frames, as required by the first postulate of relativity (it is still approximately unchanged at low velocities).

%*** comment that ${\gamma}$ is unitless and hence does not affect the units of energy or momentum

\subsection{Energy-Mass Equivalence} \label{subsect: Energy-Mass Equivalence}

Let us reflect on the invariant energy quantity from before that gives the relationship between mass and the energy of a particle at rest

\begin{equation}
	E_0 = mc^2
\end{equation}

So this means that a particle with a mass $m$ has an energy due to that mass of $mc^2$, this means if the particle were to decay into light, that light's energy could be measured and would equal to this.
Experiments have confirmed that this assertion is true and that the energy-mass equivalence is correct, at least to extremely high accuracy.
You can thank this for the ability to get energy from decaying radioactive elements in nuclear power plants, and maybe the future possibility that we can get energy output from nuclear fusion plants as well.
Though unfortunately it has been misused to make nuclear bombs.

\section{Energy-Momentum Relation For Photons} \label{sect: Energy-Momentum Relation For Photons}

*** start

The energy of photon is given by

\begin{equation}
	E = h \nu
\end{equation}

For a photon we have the mass equal to zero, so you might assume it has no momentum from this fact, but there is actually another formula that gives the momentum of a light in quantum mechanics, and that is

\begin{equation}
	p_{light} = \frac{h\nu}{c}
\end{equation}

and the lights energy is given by
\begin{equation}
	E ={c}p_{light} = h \nu
\end{equation}

where ${h}$ is Planks constant and ${\nu}$ is the frequency of the light.

now for a particle that fully decays into photons, we have the energy of the photons and the energy from the two sections ago being the same

\begin{equation}
	(h \nu)^2= (mc^2)^2 + (\gamma{m}{u}{c})^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	(h \nu)^2= m^2( c^4 + \gamma^2 u^2 c^2 )
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	(h \nu)^2= m^2( c^4 +  \frac{ u^2 c^2}{1-u^2/c^2} )
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	(h \nu)^2= m^2( \frac{ c^4 - u^2c^2}{1-u^2/c^2} +  \frac{ u^2 c^2}{1-u^2/c^2} )
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	h \nu=  \gamma m c^2
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
	\nu=  \frac{\gamma m c^2 }{h}
\end{equation}

\section{Momentum of Emmitted Light from Source}\label{sect: Momentum of Emmitted Light from Source}

*** change this to just 1 photon emitted from rest source and then see this in the primed frame, and then getting a rule for how impulse direction works for moving source

say we have a point or spherical source, that in its rest frame emits light in all directions evenly and at with the same frequency, since this is evenly distributed the momentum kick that each bit of the light produces cancel out, so that the source is still at rest.
But in another primed frame we have that the light is aberrated in the direction of movement meaning there is more light in this direction.
The light is also subject to the Doppler effect that meaning that it has a higher frequency and therefore momentum in the direction of movement.

The source in this frame will continue at its constant velocity as it remains at rest in first frame.
Therefor we need it to be that each part of the light imparts a momentum that is in the direction that the light imparts in the sources rest frame, without a change in the momentum kick that depends on the angle its emitted.

We will have the ball's energy decrease by the amount of energy of the emitted light, meaning it will lose the equivalent of this energy in its mass.
We also have a kinetic energy of the ball to think about in the primed frame.
*** should the kinetic energy of the source be the relativistic kinetic energy from before.
*** lets calculate the momentum of source and light, and calculate the energies as well, and make sure they are conserved.
